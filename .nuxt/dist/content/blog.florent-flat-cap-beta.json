  "body": "<p>After last month’s release of <a href=\"/patterns/benjamin\">Benjamin</a>, here’s another pattern release\nto channel the dapper gentleman within: the <a href=\"/patterns/florent\">Florent Flat Cap</a>.</p>\n<p>Like Benjamin, this pattern was contributed by the freesewing community, rather than\nyours truly. In this case, it was <a href=\"/users/ptzcb\">Quentin Felix</a> who signed for the design.</p>\n<p>I asked Quentin if he wanted to write this announcement blog post himself,\nbut he argued that it was time I did something too. He did have this to share\nthough, on his reasons for designing this pattern in the first place:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h5>Quentin on his reasons for designing Florent</h5>\n<p>I like wearing flat caps myself. I didn’t use to, but I have\na friend Florent who inspired me to wear them (now you know where the name comes from).</p>\n<p>The first time I made a flat cap, it took me ages to scale the\npattern to an exact fit, involving a lot of messing about with tracing paper.\nThere’s a number of patterns available online for flat caps.\nBut they all come in one size only.</p>\n<p>I wanted to make this more accessible to people. And, while I was at it,\nI also drew on my experience to add some tweaks for a better fit.</p>\n<p>For example, this design extends lower at the back of the head, which\ngives it better hold.\n{:.quote.full}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This <em>why should we always have to re-invent the wheel?</em> could\npretty much be freesewing’s slogan.</p>\n<h2>It’s the season for giving</h2>\n<p>Florent requires only one measurement: the head circumference. As such,\nthis release is perfectly timed. With the holiday season coming up,\nhere’s another gift you can make yourself.</p>\n<p>Thanks Quentin!</p>\n"
