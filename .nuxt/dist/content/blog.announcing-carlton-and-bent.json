  "body": "<p>Good news everybody, we’ve got your cosplaying needs covered. That is, if you are cosplaying as Sherlock Holmes.\nOur newest pattern release, <a href=\"/patterns/carlton\">the Carlton Coat</a> is exactly what the doctor prescribed if for some weird reason\nyour doctor wants you to look like everyone’s favorite detective.</p>\n<p>My memory is foggy on the exact origin of this endeavor. It probably involved\nme complaining about the cold and my lack of a warm winter coat, but apart from that, I’m not too sure.</p>\n<p>What I do remember is that at one point,\n<a href=\"http://www.annekecaramin.com/\">Anneke</a> and myself decided that we would reverse-engineer the Sherlock Holmes coat.\nMore specifically, the coat worn by Benedict Cumberbatch in the BBC series Sherlock Holmes.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html url=&quot;/img/blog/announcing-carlton-and-bent/bc.jpg&quot; description=“That coat though.” %}</p>\n<p>The coat is popular with cosplayers for obvious reasons, but it’s also just a really nice coat, and\nother brave souls <a href=\"http://blog.fehrtrade.com/gallery/868/the-sherlock-coat/\">such as Melissa</a> have tried their hand at it.</p>\n<p>I must admit that I didn’t know Melissa made a similar coat until mine was finished. Furthermore, her blog post\nmentions that she used the instructions in a livejournal post that is no longer available.</p>\n<p>Anneke and myself did no such thing and just put the pattern together based on screengrabs from the TV show.\nWe’re hardcore like that.</p>\n<h3>About the coat</h3>\n<p>Carlton is a double-breasted long overcoat in the tradition of horseback uniform coats\nwhere the back of the coat isn’t split, but rather has wide pleats that can drape over the back of the horse.\nOr, more realistically, fan open behind you as you walk about.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-6\">\n{% include figure.html url=\"/img/blog/announcing-carlton-and-bent/front.jpg\" description=\"Front view of Carlton on yours truly.\" %}\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-6\">\n{% include figure.html url=\"/img/blog/announcing-carlton-and-bent/back.jpg\" description=\"Back view of Carlton on yours truly.\" %}\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>It comes with two patch pockets on the front, two map pockets at the chest, and two inner pockets.\nSix pockets in total, so you’ll have plenty of room for all your belongings.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n{% include blogfigure.html img=\"pockets.jpg\" caption=\"Map and patch pockets on the outside.\" %}\n</div>\n<div class=\"col\">\n{% include blogfigure.html img=\"innerpocket.jpg\" caption=\"Inner pockets on the inside.\" %}\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>I finished mine just in time for a trip to Köln to visit my beloved friend and tailor\n<a href=\"http://sebastian-hoofs.de/massschneider/\">Sebastian Hoofs</a>.\nIt was cold as eff over there, but the coat kept me nice and warm. Not surprising since it’s made in a hefty\nwool I picked up in <a href=\"http://www.baccitessuti.it/en/index.html\">Bacci in Florence</a> over the summer, and I took\nthe extra step of interlining it with French terry (I really don’t like to be cold).</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n{% include blogfigure.html img=\"bacci.jpg\" caption=\"I have no affiliation with Bacci, I'm just a sucker for great fabric stores.\" %}\n</div>\n<div class=\"col\">\n{% include blogfigure.html img=\"interlining.jpg\" caption=\"You can see the terry interlining where I peeled back the sleeve lining.\" %}\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Burn the patriarchy to the ground through the power of pockets</h3>\n<p>Ladies take note: Carlita — a female version of Carlton — is currently on the drawing board.</p>\n<p>Initially, the plan was to release male and female versions side by side, but adapting the coat\nhas proven to be more involved than anticipated because, well, because boobs.</p>\n<p>I also feel like I have to\nkeep too many plates spinning right now, so I’m hopeful that getting Carlton out the door will\ncreate some time/space to make Carlita follow soon(ish). Either way, I’ve promised Anneke that we’d\ndo a female version, and <a href=\"/patrons\">she’s a freesewing Captain now</a>, so I intend to keep that promise.</p>\n<p>Oh, and about that title: When Carlita’s ready, she will have just as many pockets as Carlton.</p>\n<h2>Also, this: Introducing the Bent Body Block</h2>\n<p>We’re actually releasing two patterns today. Apart from the Carlton Coat, there’s also\nthe <a href=\"/patterns/bent\">Bent Body Block</a>.</p>\n<p>Bent is a two-part sleeve variation of our <a href=\"/patterns/bent\">Brian Body Block</a>. It’s essentially a base\nfor coat and jacket patterns for menswear.</p>\n<p>I originally designed Bent as a base for my <a href=\"/blog/the-refashioners-2017/\">refashioners 2017 zebra jacket</a>,\nso you can expect that jacket pattern to also hit the site in the coming months.</p>\n<p>Carlton is also based on Bent, so we’re giving you both today.</p>\n<p>Have wonderful and happy holidays if you’re into that kind of thing. And happy making!</p>\n"
