  "body": "<p>This is your monthly roundup of the freesewing news of the last four weeks, and a look at what lies ahead in the next month.</p>\n<h2>Looking back at February</h2>\n<p>I had this secret ambition to release a new pattern every month this year.\nIt’s only February and that plan seems to already have gone off the rails.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at the things that did happen in February before we talk about what didn’t.</p>\n<h3>Core v1.7.0 is out</h3>\n<p>Earlier today, I pulled the trigger on core release 1.7.0.\nAs usual, <a href=\"https://github.com/freesewing/core/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#170\">the changelog</a>\nhas all the info, but most significant to users are\n<a href=\"/docs/patterns/sven/options#ribbing\">the new ribbing options in the Sven pattern</a>, as well as\na bunch of additional improvements to Carlton/Carlita.</p>\n<p>Those Carlton/Carlita improvements are driven by the fact that myself and <a href=\"/showcase/maker/annekecaramin\">Anneke</a>\nhave started to work on <a href=\"/docs/patterns/carlton/\">the documentation\nfor these patterns</a>.\nAnd every time we write something like <em>apply fusible interfacing here</em>, we also go back to the pattern to\nmark exactly where this fusible needs to go.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, that’s a bunch of work. But it should help with the construction of these coat patterns,\nespecially for those people for which this is their first time making a coat.</p>\n<h3>GDPR battle plan</h3>\n<p>I don’t want to make it sound like writing a blog post is an achievement these days, but\nI do think <a href=\"/blog/gdpr-plan\">our <em>GDRP battle plan</em> blog post</a> is worth mentioning because\nthese are important developments, and the workload this generates is significant.</p>\n<p>While nothing is set in stone yet, the post outlines our plan to tackle GDRP-compliance,\nsomething which we’ll be focusing on in the next months.</p>\n<h3>Vim snippets for freesewing core</h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"/blog/core-vim-snippets\">a blog post that is the embodiment of the term <em>niche</em></a> we announced the\navailability of a vim plugin that provides freesewing core specific snippets.</p>\n<p>Essentially, IF you want to develop patterns and IF you use the vim editor, these are for you.</p>\n<p>Arguably, that’s a lot of ifs.</p>\n<h3>Jaeger sneak preview</h3>\n<p>Meet Jaeger, the sports coat pattern that I hoped to release this month.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html\nurl=&quot;/img/blog/roundup-2018-02/jaeger.png&quot;\ndescription=“Jaeger is ready, but I haven’t made one yet”\n%}</p>\n<p>Those of you with good memories may remember that I mentioned last month that I would\nperhaps release this during February. Although back then it still went by a different name.</p>\n<p>As I also foreshadowed last month, I did not find the time\nto make one.\nAs a matter of fact, my most problematic bottle neck in designing new patterns seems to be finding the\ntime to actually make them. Which is all the more problematic with a pattern as involved as a jacket.\nTruth be told, I’m still not sure where I found the time to make that Carlton coat.</p>\n<p>Anyway, all this to say that the pattern is ready, except that I’ve never made the latest version of it.\nAnd I feel like I can’t release it like this.</p>\n<p>So, if you’d like to make a muslin of this — or even the real thing — let me know in the\ncomments, and I’ll make sure we’ll get you a draft.</p>\n<p>That might also help moving this pattern release forward, for I already know I won’t have much time\nto work on a jacket next month.</p>\n<p>Speaking of which…</p>\n<h2>Looking ahead to March</h2>\n<p>I have two weeks of holiday in March (Yay!) the largest part of which I’ll be in Bangkok (more Yay!).</p>\n<p>That means I won’t be doing much sewing next month, but there should be some quality time for me and my laptop,\nso I wanted to tackle one of the larger items on my mid-term todo-list.</p>\n<p>My initial plan was to rewrite core, you can find some details\n<a href=\"https://github.com/freesewing/core/issues/236\">in this ticket on the matter</a></p>\n<p>However, looking ahead at the months to come, the most pressing issue is that looming GDPR deadline in May which\nwill also require a lot of work.</p>\n<p>So, I figured it would make more sense to tackle another thing on the todo list of lofty goals: rewrite the frontend.</p>\n<p>Rather than add yet another pile of jQuery code to handle all the GDPR stuff, the idea is to fork the frontend\nand port it to <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\">vue.js</a>. For this too, <a href=\"https://github.com/freesewing/site/issues/311\">there is an open issue where you can follow its progress</a>.</p>\n<p>Given that I have zero experience with vue.js, this should be fun. If you’d like to help out, please leave a comment.</p>\n"
