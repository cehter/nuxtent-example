Repeatedly hitting <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code> will move your cursor to the different arguments for the method.</p>\n<p>In other words, you can <em>tab through</em> the relevant parts of the code. Futhermore, the plugin will also suggest what needs to go in as an argument, which means it takes the guesswork out of the core API.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h5>We’ve also updated our cheatsheet</h5>\n<p>We have updated our <a href=\"/pdf/cheatsheet.pdf\">cheatsheet for pattern designers</a> to also include the snippet codes.\n{:.tip}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>But I don’t use vim</h2>\n<p>{%\ninclude floatimgonlarge.html url=&quot;/img/blog/core-vim-snippets/vim.jpg&quot;\ndescription=“vim - It’s not for everyone”\n%}\nIf you use a different editor whith snippet support, feel free to get in touch and we’ll look into porting this functionality to the editor of your choice.</p>\n<p>Or, you can do it yourself, the source code is <a href=\"https://github.com/freesewing/core-vim-snippets\">right here</a>.</p>\n"
