  "body": "<p>This is your monthly roundup of the freesewing news of the last four weeks, and a look at what lies ahead in the next month.</p>\n<h2>Looking back at september, and a bit of august</h2>\n<p>For this first edition, I’m looking back a bit further than one month, because <a href=\"/blog/open-for-business/\">this site launched at the end of August</a>, so I’m including that week in this monthly roundup.</p>\n<h3>My name is Simon, and I’m complicated</h3>\n<p>Since the launch, there’s been <a href=\"https://github.com/freesewing/core/releases\">3 new path releases of freesewing core</a> — you know, the thing that actually generates your sewing patterns — and all of them were due to issues with <a href=\"/patterns/simon\">the Simon Shirt pattern</a>.</p>\n<p>Full details are available in <a href=\"https://github.com/freesewing/core/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md\">the changelog</a>, but here’s the gist of it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The seam allowance at the hem was incorrect when the lenthBonus was very low.</li>\n<li>The cut in the sleeve for the placket was too short</li>\n<li>There was a problem with the seam allowance at the buttonhole placket</li>\n<li>The sleeve length bonus was counted double</li>\n<li>The hip measurements/ease was not taken into account;  The chest measurement/ease was used instead</li>\n<li>A number option defaults were tweaked</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"/users/yrhdw\">Tatyana</a> and <a href=\"/users/kczrw\">Stefan</a> for reporting these issues. You get that funky bug badge:</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html\nurl=&quot;/img/badges/badge-found-bug.svg&quot;\ndescription=“I really like this one”\n%}</p>\n<h4>What’s your problem Simon?</h4>\n<p>That these issues surface in Simon is not a coincidence. The pattern comes with a whopping 41 options that allow you to control pretty much every aspect of your shirt.</p>\n<p>Managing all those different combinations in the code leads to a lot of complexity. And were code complexity rises, bugs appear.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html\nurl=&quot;/img/blog/roundup-2017-09/complicated.gif&quot;\ndescription=“If Simon was on facebook, its relationship status would certainly be <em>It’s complicated</em>”\n%}</p>\n<h4>Is it time for an overhaul?</h4>\n<p>Simon is a port of the Singular Shirt pattern of <a href=\"http://MakeMyPattern.com\">MakeMyPattern.com</a>. Back there, making a differently styled shirt would have involved copying the code over, making changes, and then maintaining two slightly different variations for all eternity.</p>\n<p>Things are better here at freesewing, where inheritance is baked in the system.\nSo I could (and should perhaps) have a basic shirt pattern, and then branch that out into a bunch of differently styled shirt patterns.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>{:.folder.open} Brian Body Block\n<ul>\n<li>{:.folder.open} Basic shirt pattern\n<ul>\n<li>Casual shirt pattern</li>\n<li>Formal shirt pattern</li>\n<li>Some other shirt pattern\n{:.files}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It would not only cut down on code complexity, it would arguably also be more intuitive to see a bunch of differently styled shirt patterns, rather than have only one pattern and then have 41 options to juggle.</p>\n<p>A full Simon overhaul is going to be a bit of work, but it is possible. I’d be interested to hear your thoughts on the matter.</p>\n<h2>Dealing with email delivery issues</h2>\n<p>I added a workaround for those of you who had trouble getting the registration emails. Basically, people with an email account managed by Microsoft.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html\nurl=&quot;/img/blog/roundup-2017-09/msft.gif&quot;\ndescription=“If these guys run your inbox, then who knows what other emails you’re not getting”\n%}</p>\n<p>You can read <a href=\"/blog/email-spam-problems/\">my blog post on the matter</a> for all the details, but basically if you have one of those addresses, you should get those emails now. The only downside is that you might get them twice.</p>\n<h2>Referrals</h2>\n<p>When people link to your site, and visitors click that link, that’s called a referral. The bloggers among you might be familiar with skimming through your Google Analytics reports to see who’s been linking to you.</p>\n<p>This site does not use Google Analytics — there’s <a href=\"/blog/privacy-choices/\">a blog post with details on that</a> too — but still captures referrals. The overview of recent referrals is available for all to see on <a href=\"/status\">the status page</a>.</p>\n<p>Linking to <a href=\"http://freesewing.org\">freesewing.org</a> is obviously a nice thing to do, so I keep an eye on the referrals, and if a site shows up that belongs to a user, you get the Ambassador badge.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html\nurl=&quot;/img/badges/badge-ambassador.svg&quot;\ndescription=“Linking to <a href=\"http://freesewing.org\">freesewing.org</a> is one way to unlock the ambassafor badge”\n%}</p>\n<p>It’s a small way to say thank you for spreading the word about freesewing.</p>\n<h2>Donations</h2>\n<p>During september, we passed last year’s donations amount, so it’s nice to see I’ll be able to <a href=\"/about/pledge#donations-history\">send more money to MSF</a> this year than in 2016.</p>\n<p>You can always keep track of the donations on <a href=\"/about/pledge#donations-history\">the donations pledge page</a>, but here’s the current status:</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html\nurl=&quot;/img/blog/roundup-2017-09/donations.svg&quot;\ndescription=“Yay! Better than last year”\n%}</p>\n<h2>More download formats</h2>\n<p>I’ve also added additional formats to the draft download page. You now have a choice of SVG, PDF, letter-PDF, tabloid-PDF, A4-PDF, A3-PDF, A2-PDF, A1-PDF, and A0-PDF.</p>\n<h2>The quality control badge</h2>\n<p>I’ve added the quality control badge for things like reporting (or fixing) typos, broken links, grammar, and other small improvements.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html\nurl=&quot;/img/badges/badge-quality-control.svg&quot;\ndescription=“See a typo? Let me know and you get this”\n%}\nThese might not seem like an earth-shattering contribution, but they are important nevertheless.</p>\n<p>On the spectrum between endlessly toiling over the perfect content before publishing it, or getting it out fast warts and all, I lean heavily towards the latter.\nSo I kinda count on you guys to let me know when I messed up.</p>\n<h2>Looking ahead to october</h2>\n<p>There are 5 patterns I am currently working on. And all of them are ready to the point where I need to make them to verify that they work as intended. First a muslin, and then the real thing.</p>\n<p>That’s a bit of a bottleneck for me because I have a long commute, so my sewing time is typically limited to the weekends.</p>\n<p>The only way I see to speed up the process of getting patterns released is to have people join in with the pattern testing. I don’t think it’s something I can ask people to do, because this is early stage testing. Not to mention that I have nothing to offer them to sweeten the deal. What am I going to give you, a free pattern?</p>\n<p>Still, on the off chance that some of you want to help out by making a muslin and letting me know how it went, here’s what’s currently on my drawing board:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A trouser block for men that should be better than Theo(dore)</li>\n<li>A block for selvedge jeans for men</li>\n<li>A zip-up hoodie for men</li>\n<li>A wintercoat</li>\n<li>A unisex leggins pattern</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Should any of you want to make one of these as a test, <a href=\"/contact\">let me know</a>, it would really help me out.</p>\n"
