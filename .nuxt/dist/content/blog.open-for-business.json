Hopefully, that includes you.</p>\n<h3>Patterns vs drafts</h3>\n<p>I told you earlier that mmp generated over 6500 patterns.\nI can also tell you that mmp has 10 patterns available.</p>\n<p>So which one is it, 10 or 6500?\nWell, it depends on the context. Which is ambigious and confusing.</p>\n<p>Now, patterns are patterns, and drafts are drafts.<br>\nThat is, a draft is what you generate from a pattern. It’s a pattern drafted to your exact specifications.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html url=&quot;/img/blog/open-for-business/draft-sample.svg&quot; description=“An example of a draft from <a href=\"http://freesewing.org\">freesewing.org</a>” %}</p>\n<p>I hope that in using both terms consistently, it will become self-explanatory.</p>\n<p>So, for freesewing that means there are 12 patterns available,\nfrom which a number of drafts have been generated that you can track live on\n<a href=\"/status\">the status page</a>.</p>\n<h3>New patterns, and blocks</h3>\n<p>Currently, 12 patterns are available on <a href=\"http://freesewing.org\">freesewing.org</a>.\nAll 10 from mmp (note: some have had their name changed)\nplus the new <a href=\"/patterns/sven\">Sven Sweatshirt</a> and the <a href=\"/patterns/brian\">Brian Body Block</a>.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html url=&quot;/img/showcase/sven-nr2/med_showcase.jpg&quot; description=“An example of the Sven sweatshirt” %}\nThe block also existed in the mmp backend, but it wasn’t available to you.\nSo that’s another change, I am making all my blocks (slopers) available.</p>\n<p>And more is coming, I currently have 3 patterns and 1 block that I am working on.\nThey are not ready yet, and I didn’t want to delay the release for them,\nbut I hope to have them all out before the end of the year.</p>\n<p>What I’m saying is, watch this space.\nOr better, check the links at the bottom of this page for social media accounts to follow.</p>\n<h3>Better support for <em>les autres</em></h3>\n<p>I <a href=\"https://makemypattern.com/blog/imperial-units-have-been-spotted-and-they-might-break-things\">tried</a>\nand <a href=\"https://makemypattern.com/blog/imperial-units-not-worth-it\">failed</a> to add support for imperial units to <a href=\"http://makemypattern.com\">makemypattern.com</a>.</p>\n<p>This time around, both metric and imperial are fully supported. You can set your preferred units in your account settings.\nAnd in each model you can set the units seperately, just in case you happen to sew for people living in different parts of the world.</p>\n<p>Speaking of different parts of the world, freesewing core fully supports different languages.\nYou can get your pattern in a number of languages, and if yours is not listed you can help with the translation.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html url=&quot;/img/blog/open-for-business/yoke.svg&quot; description=“The yoke of Simon, in French” %}</p>\n<p>Arguably, that is a bit of a half-measure when this site is only in English, but baby steps, right?</p>\n<h3>Compare to catch issues early</h3>\n<p>One of the common pitfalls is that people take measurements the wrong way.</p>\n<p>When they generate a pattern, those incorrect measurements can sometimes really mess up the pattern\nin a way that can be hard to spot if you are not familiar with the pattern.</p>\n<p>One way to tackle that is with better measuring instructions, which I have added.\nBut what I really wanted was a way to make spot issues in an easy way.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html url=&quot;/img/blog/open-for-business/standing.jpg&quot; description=“These two are going to help you to take accurate measurements” %}</p>\n<p>Comparing yourself to others is the fastest way to be unhappy.\nBut in this case, there’s value to a comparison.</p>\n<p>Putting your pattern side by side with a pattern that is known to be correct\ncan help you spot any issues that go beyond size differences.</p>\n<p>So, comparison is built-in. Every time you generate a draft, you get two things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your drafted pattern</li>\n<li>A comparison of your draft to a range of standard sizes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>{% include figure.html url=&quot;/img/blog/open-for-business/compare-sample.svg&quot; description=“An example of a draft compared to standard sizes” %}\nIt’s a way to quickly eyeball your draft for any glaring issues before you start working with it.</p>\n<h3>Paperless because trees are precious, and printers not a given</h3>\n<p>Something that I am curious to see whether it will catch on are paperless drafts.</p>\n<p>Apart from the obvious upside of saving paper, I hope this will allow people who don’t have access to\na printer to use freesewing.</p>\n<p>The idea is that you don’t have to print your pattern.\nInstead, you can transfer it directly onto fabric or another medium.</p>\n<p>To make that possible, the pattern comes with detailed dimensions and a metric grid (or imperial grid if you’re into that)\nthat helps you transfer all the information.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html url=&quot;/img/blog/open-for-business/paperless-sample.svg&quot; description=“An example of a draft using the paperless theme” %}</p>\n<p>As I said, I’m curious to see whether this will be useful to people, but I felt it was worth a try.</p>\n<h3>I’ve got your back (up)</h3>\n<p>Also new is that when you draft a pattern, I will keep that draft for you, and it will remain available.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html url=&quot;/img/blog/open-for-business/draft-list.png&quot; description=“All your drafts are kept and available in your account” %}</p>\n<p>You can come back at any time to re-download the pattern, or tweak it, redraft it, or fork it.\nYes <a href=\"/docs/site/fork\">fork it</a>, which is kinda cool because you can also fork patterns from other people after they’ve shared their draft.</p>\n<p>You can also add your own notes to your drafts (and to your models for that matter).</p>\n<h3>Community-driven blog and showcase</h3>\n<p>Your makes deserve better than a Flickr album somewhere, so I’ve added showcases to the site.\nThe idea is to have a grabbag of examples here on the site of things people have made.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html url=&quot;/img/showcase/husband-hugo/med_showcase.jpg&quot; description=“Showcase of the Hugo hoodie by <a href='https://uneanneedecouture.wordpress.com/2015/12/28/le-sweat-en-merinos-makemypattern/'>uneanneedecouture</a>” %}</p>\n<p>Obviously, I can’t add your work if I don’t know about it,\nso either get in touch of make sure to use the #freesewing hashtag when posting about it.</p>\n<p>Speaking of posting, the freesewing blog is also open to your contributions if you feel you have something to share.</p>\n<h3>Badges baby</h3>\n<p>This is a bit silly, but you can now unlock <a href=\"/docs/site/badges\">badges</a> on the site.\nI added the feature initially because I wanted to find a way to\nthank the people who took part in the early access program.</p>\n<p>A while ago, I opened up an early access version of the site to\nthose people who were interested, and I would like to thank all of\nyou who tried out the site, reported issues, or merely gave feedback or encouragements.</p>\n<img alt=\"The Early Access badge\" src=\"/img/badges/badge-early-access.svg\" class=\"badge-img drop-shadow\" style=\"margin: 1%;

description=“Darkness, realistically” %}</p>\n<p>Maybe it’s just me, but after every major project comes to completion,\nI tend to slide into a black hole of <em>is this it?</em> disillusionment.</p>\n<p>I might need a few weeks to bounce back from that, but don’t let that stop you from giving me\n<a href=\"/contact\">your feedback and opinions</a> on the site.\nAnd if you manage to break something, you can <a href=\"https://github.com/freesewing/site/issues/new\">create an issue</a>.</p>\n<h2>One last thing</h2>\n<p>I’ve worked on this for about a year and a half, and especially the last 11 months or so rather intensively.</p>\n<p>Now that it’s ready, would you help me spread the news a little?</p>\n<p>If you could tell somebody about this or perhaps tweet or write about it, you’d do me a real favour.</p>\n<p>I’ve made it real easy for you with this handy box below <i class=\"fa fa-arrow-down\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></p>\n<p>Thank you</p>\n"
