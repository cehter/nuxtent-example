But it should help with the construction of these coat patterns,\nespecially for those people for which this is their first time making a coat.</p>\n<h3>GDPR battle plan</h3>\n<p>I don’t want to make it sound like writing a blog post is an achievement these days, but\nI do think <a href="/blog/gdpr-plan">our <em>GDRP battle plan</em> blog post</a> is worth mentioning because\nthese are important developments, and the workload this generates is significant.</p>\n<p>While nothing is set in stone yet, the post outlines our plan to tackle GDRP-compliance,\nsomething which we’ll be focusing on in the next months.</p>\n<h3>Vim snippets for freesewing core</h3>\n<p>In <a href="/blog/core-vim-snippets">a blog post that is the embodiment of the term <em>niche</em></a> we announced the\navailability of a vim plugin that provides freesewing core specific snippets.</p>\n<p>Essentially, IF you want to develop patterns and IF you use the vim editor, these are for you.</p>\n<p>Arguably, that’s a lot of ifs.</p>\n<h3>Jaeger sneak preview</h3>\n<p>Meet Jaeger, the sports coat pattern that I hoped to release this month.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html\nurl=&quot;/img/blog/roundup-2018-02/jaeger.png&quot;\ndescription=“Jaeger is ready, but I haven’t made one yet”\n%}</p>\n<p>Those of you with good memories may remember that I mentioned last month that I would\nperhaps release this during February. Although back then it still went by a different name.</p>\n<p>As I also foreshadowed last month, I did not find the time\nto make one.\nAs a matter of fact, my most problematic bottle neck in designing new patterns seems to be finding the\ntime to actually make them. Which is all the more problematic with a pattern as involved as a jacket.\nTruth be told, I’m still not sure where I found the time to make that Carlton coat.</p>\n<p>Anyway, all this to say that the pattern is ready, except that I’ve never made the latest version of it.\nAnd I feel like I can’t release it like this.</p>\n<p>So, if you’d like to make a muslin of this — or even the real thing — let me know in the\ncomments, and I’ll make sure we’ll get you a draft.</p>\n<p>That might also help moving this pattern release forward, for I already know I won’t have much time\nto work on a jacket next month.</p>\n<p>Speaking of which…</p>\n<h2>Looking ahead to March</h2>\n<p>I have two weeks of holiday in March (Yay!) the largest part of which I’ll be in Bangkok (more Yay!).</p>\n<p>That means I won’t be doing much sewing next month, but there should be some quality time for me and my laptop,\nso I wanted to tackle one of the larger items on my mid-term todo-list.</p>\n<p>My initial plan was to rewrite core, you can find some details\n<a href="https://github.com/freesewing/core/issues/236">in this ticket on the matter</a></p>\n<p>However, looking ahead at the months to come, the most pressing issue is that looming GDPR deadline in May which\nwill also require a lot of work.</p>\n<p>So, I figured it would make more sense to tackle another thing on the todo list of lofty goals: rewrite the frontend.</p>\n<p>Rather than add yet another pile of jQuery code to handle all the GDPR stuff, the idea is to fork the frontend\nand port it to <a href="https://vuejs.org/">vue.js</a>. For this too, <a href="https://github.com/freesewing/site/issues/311">there is an open issue where you can follow its progress</a>.</p>\n<p>Given that I have zero experience with vue.js, this should be fun. If you’d like to help out, please leave a comment.</p>\n'},{layout:"blog",title:"Speed up your pattern design work with our freesewing snippets plugin for vim",linktitle:"Announcing a freesewing snippets plugin for vim",img:"train.jpg",caption:"I do a lot of my design work on the train.

It ain’t no rocket science.</p>\n<p>If legislative texts make you run for the hills, the UKs ICO has\n<a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/">easily one of the best guides on GDPR</a>.\n{:.link}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Good to know</h3>\n<p>A few things you should know before we dive into GDPR:</p>\n<h4>There’s 100 days left</h4>\n<p>The GDPR was adopted back in 2016, but it won’t grow its teeth until May 25th 2018.</p>\n<p>Until that day, you get a pass. After that day, it’s for real.\nWhich means we have 100 days left to get our house in order.</p>\n<h4>There’s exemptions for SMEs</h4>\n<p>Organizations employing fewer than 250 people are exempt from some of the more bureaucratic aspects of the GDPR, such as a bunch of documenting requirements.</p>\n<p>Essentially, while you still have to do the right thing, there’s a lot less paperwork to fill out.</p>\n<p>Freesewing employs zero people, so we’re off the hook.</p>\n<h4>There’s extra provisions for sensitive data</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Body measurements alone are not sensitive data\n{:.quote}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The GDPR has extra provisions for <em>sensitive data</em>\nsuch as biometric data, profiling, and a bunch of other stuff.</p>\n<p>This was cause for concern because we collect body measurements, and one of our questions was whether that qualifies as biometric data.</p>\n<p>Turns out it doesn’t. Biometric data is what you can use to identify a person, like a fingerprint or iris scan. Body measurements alone are not sensitive data.</p>\n<h3>Collecting data through consent</h3>\n<p>To collect data, you need a so-called <em>lawful basis for data processing</em>.<br>\nThere are different types, but the one that applies to us (and to most online services) is <strong>consent</strong>.</p>\n<p>In this scenario, your legal basis for processing the data is that you’ve asked the person to get their data\nand they’ve freely given it to you.</p>\n<p>That is straight-forward, and makes sense. But the GDPR is really serious about making sure this consent is\nfreely given, and not wrestled from you grudgingly.</p>\n<p>To prevent companies from throwing up a big wall of legalese that people have to agree to, the GDPR outlines a number\nof principles this consent should adhere to. Here’s a non-exhaustive list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>people should have real choice and control</li>\n<li>consent requires a positive opt-in, pre-ticked boxes or anything like that are not allowed</li>\n<li>there should be a very clear statement explaining what people are agreeing to</li>\n<li>these requests for consent must be separate from any terms &amp; conditions</li>\n<li>consent needs to be granular, you need individual consent for different things, and can’t ask for blanket consent</li>\n<li>it must be easy for people to redraw consent</li>\n<li>consent of data processing should not be a precondition for a service</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Looking at that list, I can’t help but feel that legislation would be a lot simpler if lawmakers could just write\n<em>don’t be a dick</em> and call it a day.</p>\n<h4>Consent granularity</h4>\n<p>Remember, we can’t just get blanket consent.\nWe need to get consent for every type of data processing we do.</p>\n<p>For <a href="http://freesewing.org">freesewing.org</a>, we have identified three different types of data processing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Profile data</li>\n<li>Model data</li>\n<li>Patron data</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For each of these, we’ll need to get consent from the user, making sure it’s <em>real consent</em> as intended in the GDPR.</p>\n<p>Below is a mockup for what this could look like for each data type:</p>\n<p>{% include consent-profile.html %}\n{% include consent-model.html %}\n{% include consent-patron.html %}</p>\n<h4>Consent timing</h4>\n<p>The GDPR states that you should ask for consent when the data is collected.</p>\n<p>With our three types of data processing, that means that consent must be asked at different times:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Profile data</strong>: When signing up on the site</li>\n<li><strong>Model data</strong>: When creating the first model</li>\n<li><strong>Patron data</strong>: When becoming a patron</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This will (also) require some extra work to integrate this in the site.</p>\n<h3>Respecting basic rights when processing data</h3>\n<p>The EU enshrines basic rights for its citizens that should be respected when processing data.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at each of these rights and their impact on <a href="http://freesewing.org">freesewing.org</a>.</p>\n<h4>The right to be informed</h4>\n<p>{% include blockquote.html\ncontent=&quot;<h5>The right to be informed</h5>\n<p>You need to be transparent about how you use personal data. Why you collect it, how you use it, and so on.</p>\n&quot;\nicon=“info-circle”\nicolor=’#00aeff’\n%}</p>\n<p>Informing users is something we are still working on. If anything, this blog post is part of that effort.</p>\n<p>We will need to design the individual privacy notices, but also a more overall privacy policy as well as\nmaking certain that users are informed of all their rights.</p>\n<p>While this will require some work, I don’t expect any problems here.</p>\n<h4>The right of access</h4>\n<p>{% include blockquote.html\ncontent=&quot;<h5>The right of access</h5>\n<p>People have the right to know their data is processed, and to access that data.</p>\n&quot;\nicon=“eye”\nicolor=’#6f4c36’\n%}</p>\n<p>We are already compliant, as all data users enter on the site can also be accessed by them.</p>\n<h4>The right to rectification</h4>\n<p>{% include blockquote.html\ncontent=&quot;<h5>The right to rectification</h5>\n<p>People have the right to correct their data if it’s not correct.</p>\n&quot;\nicon=“pencil”\nicolor=’#c52a00’\n%}</p>\n<p>We are already compliant, as all data users enter on the site can also be edited by them.</p>\n<h4>The right to erasure</h4>\n<p>{% include blockquote.html\ncontent=&quot;<h5>The right to erasure</h5>\n<p>People have the right to have their data removed/erased.</p>\n&quot;\nicon=“trash”\nicolor=’#727272’\n%}</p>\n<p>We are already compliant, as users can remove their models, or entire account at any time.</p>\n<h4>The right to restrict processing</h4>\n<p>{% include blockquote.html\ncontent=&quot;<h5>The right to restrict processing</h5>\n<p>This right means that users must be able to put a <em>freeze</em> on all data processing, without going as far as to delete their data.</p>\n&quot;\nicon=“pause-circle”\nicolor=’#ffa239’\n%}</p>\n<p>We do not currently offer this possibility, and will need to add this functionality to the site.</p>\n<h4>The right to data portability</h4>\n<p>{% include blockquote.html\ncontent=&quot;<h5>The right to data portability</h5>\n<p>People not only have a right to export all their data, that export should also be in a format that makes it easy for them to take their data elsewhere.</p>\n&quot;\nicon=“suitcase”\nicolor=’#444’\n%}</p>\n<p>We are already compliant, as we allow users to export all of their data, and make it available in different standard formats (YAML and JSON).</p>\n<h4>The right to object</h4>\n<p>{% include blockquote.html\ncontent=&quot;<h5>The right to object</h5>\n<p>The right to object applies specifically to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>processing for public interests or by official authorities</li>\n<li>processing for direct marketing</li>\n<li>processing for science/historic research/statistics</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In these cases, people can object to this specific processing.</p>\n&quot;\nicon=“hand-paper-o”\nicolor=’#ad6224’\n%}</p>\n<p>This is going to apply to us when we start publishing anonymized model data, something that’s on our roadmap.</p>\n<p>The reason for publishing this data is that we want to make a dataset available of <em>real</em> body measurements, rather than the\n<em>standard</em> measurements that are typically used in the industry.</p>\n<p>This is something we’ll write about more at a later date, but essentially this falls under the <em>scientific research/statistics</em> category.\nAnd even though the data is anonimized, we still need to respect the right of users to object to this processing.</p>\n<p>As such, we should add the possibility to object to this specific use of the data.</p>\n<h4>Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling</h4>\n<p>{% include blockquote.html\ncontent=&quot;<h5>Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling</h5>\n<p>People have extra rights when it comes to profiling or decisions made by AI or algorithms without human involvement.</p>\n&quot;\nicon=“cogs”\nicolor=’#37874c’\n%}</p>\n<p>This is not relevant in our situation.</p>\n<h3>Privacy by design</h3>\n<p>The EU isn’t content with throwing up a couple of consent questions and respecting people’s rights when processing data.\nIt also wants to make certain that your privacy is (better) protected when things go wrong.</p>\n<p>That’s why it advocates for <em>privacy by design</em>. While it’s a concept that’s hard to pin down in legislation, the\npurpose is clear: They want everyone to consider privacy from the very start of their project/product/business, and\nnot as an afterthought.</p>\n<p>Things such as encryption (both in transit and for data at-rest), pseudonyms, and data expiry are suggested as\nthings to keep in mind while designing.</p>\n<p>Obviously, the EU is not going to come check your code to see whether you’ve taken privacy by design to heart.\nBut it can (and probably will) have an influence when things to wrong.</p>\n<p>Imagine two companies who have a data leak, one of them hasn’t done much to safeguard the privacy of their users,\nwhereas the other has taken <em>privacy by design</em> measures to mitigate the damage.</p>\n<p>It seems obvious that the EU is going to come down harder on the company who didn’t even try.</p>\n<h4>What we’re already doing</h4>\n<p>We already do a number of things that are driven by a <em>privacy by design</em> approach. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We use pseudonyms for user accounts</li>\n<li>We don’t share any data with any third party</li>\n<li>We don’t include any tracking code, or analytics</li>\n<li>We don’t use cookies</li>\n<li>We don’t have any social logins, like buttons, or other such things</li>\n<li>We don’t run/show any ads</li>\n<li>We don’t run any third-party JavaScript code</li>\n<li>We use encryption on all transport</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There’s some more info on this in this blog post:\n<a href="/blog/privacy-choices/">The choices I’ve made to protect your privacy. Or why you won’t be getting any cookies</a>.</p>\n<p>These already form a very good basis for a privacy conscious website. But since we’ll need to make changes\nfor GDPR anyway, we’re considering other options to further raise the privacy bar.\nSpecifically, what can we do to limit the damage to our users in case there is a data leak.</p>\n<h4>Restriction of data storage</h4>\n<p>Some of the most sensitive data we store today is the address and birthday of our higher-tier patrons.</p>\n<p>However, the site does not need this information to function. We only need it for administrative purposes;\nSending out gifts and birthday cards to our patrons.</p>\n<p>As such, there’s no real need to keep this data in the freesewing database.\nWe could just as well write this information down in a notebook we keep on our coffee table.</p>\n<p>So, as part of our GDPR-related changes, we will remove this information from the database, and store it\noffline.</p>\n<h4>Encryption of data at rest</h4>\n<p>We already encrypt all data in transit. But, we are currently considering to add encryption of data at rest.</p>\n<p>The idea is to encrypt all data that could potentially identify a user.\nSuch as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Email address</li>\n<li>User name</li>\n<li>Model names</li>\n<li>Model notes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This would add an extra layer of defense for our users’ privacy in case somehow our database gets dumped.</p>\n<p>While this change will be non-trivial to implement and come with a performance penalty, I feel it’s\nworth looking in to.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>While we still have some work to do, we are already compliant with large parts of the GDPR, especially when\nit comes to respecting users rights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>{:.ongoing} The right to be informed</li>\n<li>{:.done} The right of access</li>\n<li>{:.done} The right to rectification</li>\n<li>{:.done} The right to erasure</li>\n<li>{:.blocking} The right to restrict processing</li>\n<li>{:.done} The right to data portability</li>\n<li>{:.blocking} The right to object</li>\n<li>{:.done} Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling\n{:.todo}</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are currently working on <em>the right to be informed</em> and have a plan\nfor the changes required to respect <em>the right to restrict processing</em> and <em>the right to object</em>.</p>\n<p>On the data collection site, we need to hammer out the details for our privacy notices.\nWe’ll also write a detailed privacy policy that bundles all the info from the different notices.</p>\n<p>We’ll need to add changes to the user on-boarding to make sure notices are presented at the correct time.\nNot to mention that we’ll need to keep track of who gave their consent for what.</p>\n<h3>Action points</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Draft privacy notices for profile/model/patron data</li>\n<li>Integrate consent in user on-boarding, model creation, and patron sign-up</li>\n<li>Make site functionality depend on consent</li>\n<li>Provide a centralized privacy dashboard where people can review their privacy settings/consent</li>\n<li>Add email notifications every time consent is changed</li>\n<li>Provide a way for people to <em>freeze</em> their account</li>\n<li>Provide a way for people to object to their model data being used for research and statistics</li>\n<li>Write and publish an overall privacy policy</li>\n<li>Encrypt sensitive data in the database\n{:.todo}</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Seems like we’ve got a lot of work ahead of us.</p>\n<h3>Feedback</h3>\n<p>It is my personal opinion that the GDPR is a good thing.\nBut I want to hear from you about the changes outlined in this blog post.</p>\n<p>So please reach out with your feedback and comments.\nIt is after all your data we’re talking about.</p>\n'},{layout:"blog",title:"Monthly roundup - January 2018: Inkscape DPI, version awareness, Bail, and Carlita",linktitle:"Monthly roundup; January 2018 edition",img:"potw.jpg",caption:"Your new login background for the month of February",author:"Joost De Cock",category:"roundup",blurb:"A roundup of all the freesewing news of the last month",meta:{index:3,fileName:"2018-01-31-roundup-2018-01.md",section:"/blog",dirName:"/"},date:"2018-01-31",path:"/blog/blog/roundup-2018-01",permalink:"/blog/roundup-2018-01",anchors:[["#04-https-github-com-freesewing-core-issues-204","04](https://github.com/freesewing/core/issues/204)"]],body:'<p>This is your monthly roundup of the freesewing news of the last four weeks, and a look at what lies ahead in the next month.</p>\n<h2>Looking back at January</h2>\n<p>{% include figure.html\nurl=&quot;/img/blog/roundup-2018-01/coffee.gif&quot;\ndescription=“More like <em>this month</em>”\n%}\nIt might be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/19/aint-no-sunshine-winter-darkest-europe">the record-breaking depressing weather in my neck of the woods\n</a>,\nbut I feel like January took a lot out of me. So let’s see if we have at least something\nto show for it.</p>\n<h3>The Inkscape default units quandary</h3>\n<p>At the start of the year, we rolled out core v1.3.0 to address <a href="https://github.com/freesewing/core/issues/204">issue #204</a>\naka the the Inkscape default units quandary.</p>\n<p>It was a bit of an unusual fix because our hand was forced due to upstream changes made by the\nInkscape developers. In addition, we didn’t only have to adapt our code, but also had to backport\nthe changes to all your existing drafts.</p>\n<p>If you were blissfully unaware of the whole thing, we wrote a blog post about it:\n<a href="https://joost.freesewing.org/blog/core-v1.3.0-is-out/">Freesewing core v1.3.0 is out; Comes with fixes so good that we back-ported them to all your drafts</a>.</p>\n<h3>Version awareness</h3>\n<p>We now keep track of which version of core generated your draft. We roll out fixes and improvements\nall the time. So the drafts you have stored in your profile might be outdated.</p>\n<p>You are now informed about this, both on the draft’s page itself and on your list of drafts.\nA simple redraft will upgrade them to the latest version.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h5>Long-term vision for versioning</h5>\n<p>This solution is a step up from the previous situation, but it doesn’t allow for very\ngranular version control. If you have 10 different Simon drafts stored in your profile, and we\nbump the core version number because we made a tweak to Carlton, all your drafts are marked\nas outdated, even though the changes don’t impact them.</p>\n<p>With only a single core version number to depend on, there’s no obvious way for us to keep track\nof what changes impact what pattern.</p>\n<p>The long-term plan here is to have a core version number and a pattern version number.\nThis way, a version bump in one pattern will not impact other patterns.</p>\n<p>A version bump in core will still impact all patterns, but there should be far fewer core versions\nonce we take all patterns out of core.</p>\n<p>The idea is that every pattern will be in its own repository, and we’ll use composer to manage them\nas dependencies.</p>\n<p>But this is a long-term idea that won’t be implemented until after we rewrite core.\nYes, that’s another long-term idea.\n{:.comment}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Bail for error handling</h3>\n<p>In the first half of the month, we tried Rollbar for error handling and reporting.\nWhile we liked the functionality it provided, we weren’t too happy about the possible impact on\nyour privacy of sending that kind of data to a third party.</p>\n<p>So, we decided to write our own poor man’s rollbar called Bail. Bail is now used in our data\nand core backends, so when things break, we know about it.</p>\n<p>This effort also lead to a 2-week side-quest to write tests for our data backend. All details:\n<a href="/blog/introducing-bail/">Introducing freesewing bail: A poor man’s rollbar — because privacy</a></p>\n<h3>Carlita is here</h3>\n<p>A couple of days ago, we released the <a href="/patterns/carlita">Carlita Coat</a>,\nthe womenswear version of our Carlton coat.</p>\n<p>If you rushed out to get your hands on Carlita, it’s good to know that she was released as\npart of core v1.6.0 and we’re now at v1.6.3, and that is mostly due to fixes and tweaks in\nCarlton/Carlita.</p>\n<p>If you’ve got an earlier version of the pattern, please redraft. If you’ve already printed\nit, perhaps have a look at <a href="https://github.com/freesewing/core/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md">the changelog</a>\nto figure out what has changed.</p>\n<p>If you check the changelog, you’ll also see that we started the month on core v1.2.9 and\nare now running core v1.6.3, so I don’t think it’s just an idea that it was a busy month.</p>\n<h2>Looking ahead to February</h2>\n<p>February is a short month so it’s probably best to manage expectations. But here’s\nwhat I have in mind for it:</p>\n<h3>Carlton/Carlita documentation</h3>\n<p>Quite frankly, this is like pulling teeth to me, so don’t expect it to be finished by the\nend of February, but I should at least have made some progress on the\ndocumentation for the Carlton and Carlita patterns.</p>\n<p>On a related note, the increasing popularity of this site means I’m a lot more occupied with\nvarious questions, and small issues that need my attention.</p>\n<p>All that feedback is a good thing\nfor it is how we improve things around here. But I do notice that it is becoming increasingly\ndifficult to dedicate a larger chunk of time to one specific thing.\nWhich is really what you need when tackling larger tasks such as writing documentation\nor designing new patterns.</p>\n<p>I don’t really have a solution for that, I’m just making the observation.</p>\n<h3>Maybe a Blake Blazer release</h3>\n<p>I have a jacket pattern on my drawing board that’s been there since the summer (it’s called the Blake Blazer).\nI really should just take out some time to wrap it up and publish it, but\nI’ve been reluctant to do so because I can’t seem to find the time to actually make\nthe jacket.</p>\n<p>I’ve used the pattern before for\n<a href="/blog/the-refashioners-2017/">my refashioners make this year</a>,\nbut that’s not exactly\na very representative example.</p>\n<p>I don’t think I’ll find the time to make a jacket in February, but perhaps a muslin is enough\nto publish it in beta.</p>\n<h3>FOSDEM</h3>\n<p>{% include figure.html\nurl=&quot;/img/blog/roundup-2018-01/fosdem.png&quot;\ndescription=“All details on <a href=\'http://fosdem.org\'>fosdem.org</a>”\n%}</p>\n<p><a href="http://fosdem.org/">FOSDEM</a> — the Free and Open Source Developers’ European Meeting —\nis on the first weekend of February in Brussels.</p>\n<p>I’m planning to be there on Sunday, so if you’re attending too, let me know or come and say hi.</p>\n'},{layout:"blog",title:"Announcing Carlita, the womenswear version of our Carlton coat.",linktitle:"Announcing the Carlita Coat",img:"sherlock.jpg",caption:"Picture you and him, in matching coats.",author:"Joost De Cock",category:"core",blurb:"Announcing the Carlita coat, the womenswear version of our Carlton coat pattern.",meta:{index:4,fileName:"2018-01-26-announcing-carlita.md",section:"/blog",dirName:"/"},date:"2018-01-26",path:"/blog/blog/announcing-carlita",permalink:"/blog/announcing-carlita",anchors:[],body:'<p>This one’s for the ladies — and I’m not (just) talking about that picture of heart-throb Benedict Cumberbatch at the top of this post.</p>\n<p>Instead, I’m talking about the release of our latest pattern:\nthe <a href="/patterns/carlita">Carlita Coat</a> which is out in beta as of today.</p>\n<p>Carlita is — you guessed it — the womenswear version of our Carlton coat, which recreates the iconic Sherlock\nHolmes coat worn by BC on the BBC series.</p>\n<h2>How did we do it?</h2>\n<p>For details on how this project came to be,\nI refer you to <a href="/blog/announcing-carlton-and-bent/">the Carlton announcement post</a>.\nHere, I’d like to focus on the specifics of how we turned this menswear pattern into a coat for ladies.</p>\n<p>We wanted to stay as close to the original as possible, so all we did was make changes to address\none challenge: fitting the breasts.</p>\n<h3>Princess, meet your seam</h3>\n<p>We drew an extra princess seam in the front panel of the coat, through which we added shaping for the bust.</p>\n<p>To be able to do that accurately, Carlita requires three extra measurements in addition to the measurements required by Carlton. They are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <a href="/docs/measurements/#highBust">high bust</a></li>\n<li>The <a href="/docs/measurements/#bustSpan">bust span</a></li>\n<li>The <a href="/docs/measurements/#highPointShoulderToBust">high point shoulder to bust</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We use your high bust measurements to draft the coat, and then do a full bust adjustment on the\nprincess seam based on your (full) chest circumference, bust span and HPS to bust.</p>\n<h3>All of the pockets, but we had to move some of them</h3>\n<p>The addition of the princess seam made the map pocket placement a bit difficult,\nso we’ve slightly moved it, and aligned it vertically, rather than slightly tilted as it is in Carlton.</p>\n<p>This way, the pocket can be integrated in the princess seam, somewhere in the underboob region.</p>\n<h3>One extra option: The princess seam smooth factor</h3>\n<p>Carlita also has one extra option that Carlton doesn’t have, the somewhat elaborately named\n<a href="/docs/patterns/carlita/options#princessSeamSmoothFactor">Princess seam smooth factor</a>.</p>\n<p>This controls how sharply the princess seam will revert back after having added the extra volume for your chest.</p>\n<p>A picture says more than a thousand words, so here’s the option sampled on the relevant part of the pattern:</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html\nurl=&quot;/img/blog/announcing-carlita/smooth.png&quot;\ndescription=“The effect of the option as shown by our sampler service”\n%}</p>\n<p>As you can see, the option controls the urgency with which the princess seam reverts back to your waistline\nafter passing the fullest point of your bust.</p>\n<p>A low factor will make for a more fitted coat, but also a more curvy seam that is harder to sew.</p>\n<p>A higher smooth factor will smooth this out so it’s a more sloped retreat to the downward seam.\nThis will make the coat less fitted under your chest, and the seam easier to sew.</p>\n<h2>A reminder about made-to-measure patterns</h2>\n<p>This goes without saying for regular visitors to this site, but if you’re new here, it’s worth repeating:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This coat is not drafted with a certain cup size in mind. Instead, it will adapt to your chest based on your measurements.\n{:.tip}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Ladies, we need your feedback</h2>\n<p>This is our first womenswear pattern with a fitted chest.\nAs such, we’re breaking new ground here, and I’d be interested to see how this pattern adapts to a variety of body shapes/cup sizes.</p>\n<p>If you’re planning to make this coat, or a muslin of it, please share your experience, and don’t hesitate to get in\ntouch should you run into any issues.</p>\n<p>I plan to design more womenswear patterns, so if there are any fit issues, I’d like to know about it sooner rather than later.</p>\n<h2>Shout-out</h2>\n<p>Last but not least, I’d like to thank <a href="http://www.annekecaramin.com/">Anneke</a> for her help throughout this project, and tolerating my countless rants about\nmy love/hate relationship with boobs.</p>\n'},{layout:"blog",title:"Introducing freesewing bail: A poor man's rollbar — because privacy",linktitle:"Introducing freesewing bail",img:"hammer.jpg",caption:"This blog post is not at all about hammers",author:"Joost De Cock",category:"docs",blurb:"Bail is a poor man's Rollbar, because privacy.",meta:{index:5,fileName:"2018-01-21-introducing-bail.md",section:"/blog",dirName:"/"},date:"2018-01-21",path:"/blog/blog/introducing-bail",permalink:"/blog/introducing-bail",anchors:[],body:'<p>One of the more tricky things we have to deal with here at <a href="http://freesewing.org">freesewing.org</a> is the so-called\n<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out">garbage in, garbage out</a> problem.\nWhen our users enter flawed input data, it leads to nonsensical output or <em>garbage</em>.</p>\n<p>For us, that flawed input data is — almost without exception — incorrect measurements.\nSometimes people aren’t certain how to take measurements,\nother times they make wrong assumptions or simply get their units mixed up.</p>\n<p>Point is, it happens.

I enabled notifications for every error level under the sun.\nSo even harmless notices were being reported.</p>\n<h2>Moving fast and breaking things</h2>\n<p>One of the errors that came in was related to the way we handle certain types of\ninformation in our data backed. Specifically, data serialized as JSON.\nIt was the weekend, I had some time, so I went it to <em>quickly fix this thing</em>.\nSuffice to say it didn’t go well.</p>\n<p>Turns out that in fixing this one thing, I broke a bunch of other stuff without realizing it,\nand I left the site in a half-broken state where for some people, things just wouldn’t work.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html\nurl=&quot;/img/blog/introducing-bail/giphy.gif&quot;\ndescription=“This will probably not be the last time I break something”\n%}</p>\n<p>That’s not good, and I spent much of the remaining weekend undoing the damage,\nnot to mention giving myself a stern talking to about how this should never happen again.</p>\n<h2>A side-quest into writing tests, and adding Sqlite support</h2>\n<p>Smart developers write so-called <em>tests</em> that validate the correct behavior of their code.\nWhen you make a change, you run those tests to verify your change doesn’t have\nunexpected ripple effects that cause things to break.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mistakes happen, that’s not going to change, but we should learn from them.\n{:.quote}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I know that, and our core backend has such tests, but our data backend was written\nin a bit in a scramble to get this site up and running, and I had never gotten around to it.</p>\n<p>Mistakes happen, that’s not going to change, but we should learn from them.\nSo while I don’t find writing unit tests to be particularly interesting,\nI put everything I was working on on-hold, and vowed to write tests for the entire data backend first.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html\nurl=&quot;/img/blog/introducing-bail/coverage.png&quot;\ndescription=“From no tests to 99.88% test coverage for our data backend”\n%}</p>\n<p>But our data backend uses a database, and for thorough testing, we needed a test database.\nWhile that’s easy enough to setup on a development machine, it’s less trivial to do on\n<a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis</a>, which we use for continious integration.</p>\n<p>Long story short, our data repository is now compatible with Sqlite, a lightweight file-based database.\nThis allows us to simply include a test database file with our test code, but also makes it easier for\ndevelopers to setup their own data instance.</p>\n<h2>Next roadblock: Privacy &amp; GDPR</h2>\n<p>With the tests in place, I could once again turn my attention to spotting and fixing potential gotchas.\nBut that’s when I hit another issue: front-end errors.</p>\n<p>You see, errors on the back-end only tell part of the story.\nIf we really want to understand what goes on when one of our users runs into a problem,\nwe need reporting on the client side to.</p>\n<p>And while Rollbar supports this, we could not in good conscience embed their error reporting code into our website.\nThat’s because Rollbar is a third-party.\nAnd while we may want to share our backend data with them for debugging purposes,\nfront end data is <strong>your data</strong>.\nInformation about your platform, browser, are all recorded, stored, and processed by Rollbar, outside of our control.</p>\n<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about privacy lately, as I am preparing to publish a privacy notice for the site\nin line with the\n<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR legislation of the European Union</a>.</p>\n<p>I think GDPR is a good thing, but its rules on getting consent from your users are both strict and granular.\nYou can’t just throw up a <em>please agree to let us do whatever</em> notice, but need to ask permission for\nevery thing you want to do.</p>\n<p>Adding rollbar would require consent for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sharing data with a third party</li>\n<li>Moving data outside the EU</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Not only would that complicate our privacy notice. I also happen to really like that we’re able to so that\nwe do not share your data, and we keep it in the EU.</p>\n<p>So Rollbar is out on principle alone.</p>\n<h2>Introducing Freesewing Bail</h2>\n<p>Our 2-week trial has shown that there’s value in a rollbar-like service that collects and reports errors.</p>\n<p>So after some to and froing, I decided to bite the bullet and write our own rollbar.\nNot the entire thing, but a minimalistic version of it that did what we needed, without involving any third parties.</p>\n<p>Rather than somehow hack this into our data and core backends,\nI wrote it as a seperate library that we can simply plug in to both.</p>\n<p>It’s called <a href="https://github.com/freesewing/bail">bail</a> and as of today we are running it on our all production system.\nIf you’d like to give it a go, a simple <code>composer require freesewing/bail</code> will add it to your PHP project.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html\nurl=&quot;/img/blog/introducing-bail/dashboard.png&quot;\ndescription=“This is what our new error dashboard looks like”\n%}</p>\n<p>Errors are collected centrally, and you can keep an eye on what’s going on in <a href="/errors">our error dashboard</a>.</p>\n<p>And yes, that includes that front end too.\nAnytime something goes wrong on this website, it will be reported.\nThe idea is that this will help us continually improve our code base, and help people who run into issues.</p>\n<p>And you can test this yourself.

A change that goes in effect from version\n0.92 onwards.</p>\n<p>Left unchecked, this change would cause all freesewing patterns to be incorrectly scaled.\nThat’s because we assume 90DPI in our SVG output, and scale accordingly.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html\nurl=&quot;/img/blog/core-v1.3.0-is-out/oh-shit.gif&quot;\ndescription=“That ‘oh-shit’ moment when we realized the full impact of the DPI change”\n%}\nWhen the switch to 96DPI goes into effect, all patterns would be off by 6.66%. Which is really\nthe kind of difference that is too small to notice when eyeballing a pattern, yet large enough\nto completely mess up your garment.</p>\n<p>The issue is also more troublesome than it would seem at the surface.\nFirst of all because we can’t just switch to 96DPI as there are now two versions out there\nthat use a different default DPI under the hood. We need a solution that works for both.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html\nurl=&quot;/img/blog/core-v1.3.0-is-out/inkscape.png&quot;\ndescription=“Screenshot of a freesewing pattern that is incorrectly scaled in the latest Inkscape release”\n%}</p>\n<p>Furthermore, while any fix we implement would apply to new drafts,\nall existing drafts generated before the fix would still be impacted.</p>\n<p>In other words, if you drafted a pattern last week, or a month ago, that pattern would not\nscale correctly in a recent version of Inkscape.<br>\nAnd since we use Inkscape in our SVG-to-PDF tool-chain, it would also be incorrectly scaled\nif you came here and downloaded a PDF.</p>\n<p>Clearly, something needed to be done. And fast.</p>\n<h2>The fix for new drafts</h2>\n<p>From today’s release of core v1.3.0 onwards, our SVG files no longer depend on any DPI setting.</p>\n<p>Rather than use the internal units and apply an SVG transform to scale the entire\npattern, we’ve bolted down the units to mm and updated the SVG viewBox to apply the scaling.</p>\n<p>Obviously, this is how we should have done it from the start. Everyday is a school day.</p>\n<p>If you’re worried about the use of mm in your draft (because you’re used to imperial\nunits), rest assured that those mm will stay under the hood. You won’t be able to tell the difference.</p>\n<h2>The fix for pre-existing drafts</h2>\n<p>To avoid problems with pre-existing drafts, we needed to come up with a solution for those too.</p>\n<p>We essentially have two options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Re-draft all those drafts</li>\n<li>Patch them in-place without changing the draft itself</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Re-drafting fixes the issue as every new draft will be handled by the latest core version\nthat does include the fix.</p>\n<p>However, core also ships with regular updates, tweaks, and fixes in the patterns themselves.\nSo by re-drafting a draft generated on a previous version of core, there’s no guarantee the\ndraft won’t change.</p>\n<p>In principle that change would always be an improvement.

I’m glad you asked:</p>\n<h3>We have patrons now</h3>\n<p>This was really big news for me, and something that we had been working on behind the scenes for a good while.\nBut 3 weeks ago, we finally unveiled our new patron system.</p>\n<p>The <a href="/blog/calling-all-patrons/">announcement blog post</a> has all the details, plus an open-hearted look at the\nfinancial side of this project. If you haven’t read it yet, I recommend it.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html url=&quot;/img/blog/calling-all-patrons/patrons-ig.png&quot; description=“Spreading the word about our new patron approach” %}</p>\n<p>The gist of it is that we are building a bedrock of loyal supporters to ensure a\nsustainable future for <a href="http://freesewing.org">freesewing.org</a>, our code, our patterns, and our community.</p>\n<p>These people are our Patrons, and they support us with a small monthly contribution.\nWe have three tiers, and they all come with their own prices and perks. You can find all the info\non <a href="/patrons/join">the patrons sign-up page</a>.</p>\n<p>We are 3 weeks in now, and so far <a href="/patrons">25 people</a> have shown their support for this project by becoming a patron.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, this is truly wonderful news that we’re all very excited about.</p>\n<h3>A logo tweak</h3>\n<p>The roll out of our patron system had an unforeseen side-effect: We needed to simplify the freesewing logo a bit\nso we could order all that swag with the logo on it.</p>\n<div class="row">\n<div class="col">\n{% include figure.html url="/img/logo/logo-flag.png" description="The new logo" %}\n</div>\n<div class="col">\n{% include figure.html url="/img/blog/roundup-2017-12/old-logo-flag.png" description="The old logo" %}\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Turns out there’s a limit to the amount of detail you can get embossed into jeans rivets or buttons, or woven into labels.\n(that’s just some of the swag our patrons get).</p>\n<p>So, we’ve streamlined the logo a bit. It’s been on the site and our social media accounts since December 10th, but\nwe hadn’t updated our auto-generated avatars yet. That’s something we’ve managed to squeeze in in the last hours of\nDecember (and the year) so that’s good too.</p>\n<h3>New patterns</h3>\n<p>We’ve had three (yes 3) pattern releases in December.</p>\n<div class="row">\n<div class="col">\n{% include figure.html url="/img/patterns/florent/cover.jpg" description="The Florent flat cap" %}\n</div>\n<div class="col">\n{% include figure.html url="/img/patterns/carlton/cover.jpg" description="The Carlton coat" %}\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><a href="/patterns/florent">Florent</a> is a flat cap pattern that was contributed by\n<a href="/users/ptzcb">Quentin</a>. The <a href="/blog/florent-flat-cap-beta/">announcement blog post</a> has all the details.</p>\n<p>Then later this month, we published <a href="/patterns/carlton">Carlton</a> and <a href="/patterns/bent">Bent</a>, the block it’s based on.\nI’ve worked with <a href="/showcase/maker/annekecaramin">Anneke</a> to make this pattern happen, and a female version of the coat is coming.\nYou know what, you should probably read all about it <a href="/announcing-carlton-and-bent/">in this blog post</a>.</p>\n<h3>Model name and draft reference are now printed on every pattern part</h3>\n<p>We got a request to add the model and draft info to the printed pattern. People who were using a given pattern\nfor different people (imagine making a hoodie for yourself and your partner) got confused about which parts belonged to which draft.</p>\n<p>That seemed like a good idea to us, so we’ve added this info to the patterns. If you have an\nolder draft in your account, you can simply re-draft it to update it.</p>\n<h3>Data export</h3>\n<p>We’ve grouped a few harder to find pages in a new <a href="/tools/">Tools</a> entry in the account section of the menu.</p>\n<p>It contains a link to our RSS feed of the blog, our on-demand tiler, and a link to remove your account,\nbut none of those are new, we’ve just grouped them so they’d be easier to find.</p>\n<p>What is new is the ability to export all the data we have on file for you.</p>\n<p>This work is in preparation of the changes we’ll be making next month, which brings me to:</p>\n<h2>Looking ahead to January</h2>\n<p>There’s new patterns in the pipeline, but I’m not ready to commit to a deadline for these yet, mostly because\nwe have a bunch of other stuff on our plate. Including:</p>\n<h3>Open data and privacy talk</h3>\n<p>We had a bit of a debate about whether or not we should publish anonymized measurements data here at freesewing.</p>\n<p>I won’t repeat everything here, but <a href="https://twitter.com/j__st/status/941586171158777856">our tweet</a>\nand <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bct2jUEnuS9/">Instagram post</a> on the topic get a lot of responses.</p>\n<p>A vast majority of people supports this idea, and as such we have plans to move ahead with it.\nHowever, if we do this, we want to do it right and completely in the open.\nSo expect a blog post on the matter shortly.</p>\n<p>The questions that came up as we were discussing the possibility of publishing this data tend to\nrevolve around privacy. We are — and remain — committed to protecting the privacy or all\nour users and visitors, and have written about\n<a href="/blog/privacy-choices/">the choices we have made to guarantee your privacy</a>.</p>\n<p>Thinking about these issues made us realize that we want to provide a more iron-clad\nguarantee than a blog post. So, we will draft and publish a privacy notice in line\nwith the upcoming GDPR.</p>\n<p>Don’t know what GDPR is? Good. Keep reading.</p>\n<h3>GDPR compliance</h3>\n<p>The GDPR is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">General Data Protection Regulation</a>\nof the European Union.  It replaces the <em>Data Protection Directive</em> and is a more ambitious piece of\ndata protection legislation.</p>\n<p>The GDPR will become active in May 2018, and by that time, freesewing will be ready for it.\nSpecifically, we will publish a privacy notice that outlines exactly what happens to your data,\nand we will make certain that all your rights are respected.</p>\n<p>We are still planning how exactly we will tackle this, and for the most part, these will be cosmetic changes\nand that won’t change anything about freesewing as such.</p>\n<p>But we value your privacy, and we want to practice what we preach, so we’ll be making sure to do what’s right.</p>\n<h3>Core issue #204 - The Inkscape default units quandary</h3>\n<p>Under the heading <em>Important changes</em> the\n<a href="http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/Release_notes/0.92#Important_changes">release notes for Inkscape\nversion 0.92</a> list:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The default resolution was changed from 90dpi to 96dpi, to match the CSS standard.\n{:.warning}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This seemingly trivial update to the open source SVG editor will have some profound ripple effects for freesewing.</p>\n<p>While it won’t impact our code as such, we use Inkscape to turn the SVG patterns we generate into the PDFs that you\nprint at home. And if now Inkscape thinks that one inch no longer holds 90, but 96 pixels, your patterns will be\nscaled incorrectly, which is kind of a big deal.</p>\n<p>Given that we can continue to run an older build of Inkscape to do our bidding, this doesn’t mean things are on fire just yet.\nBut it’s a problem we will have to tackle sooner rather than later.</p>\n<p>That’s because even when we fix it, once we start using the new Inkscape, it will still incorrectly handle the drafts\nthat have been generated prior to the fix and that are still stored in people’s profiles.<br>\nNeedless to say, I see a lot of mucking about with the SVG viewbox in my future.</p>\n<p>There’s other changes in the newest Inkscape too that can potentially wreak havoc. Most likely to cause a stink-up\nis the new way the <em>line-height</em> attribute will be handled in text. Less dramatic, but still inconvenient.</p>\n<p>While these changes add an unwelcome number of entries to our to-do list, it’s worth pointing out that\nthe Inkscape maintainers make these changes because they thing it’s the right thing, and that going forward,\nthis will be the better option.</p>\n<p>So, in the same spirit, we’ll make sure to follow suit.</p>\n<p>But that’s for next year.</p>\n'},{layout:"blog",title:"Announcing Carlton, aka the Sherlock Holmes coat, and the Bent Body Block.",linktitle:"Announcing the Carlton Coat and Bent Body Block",img:"coat.jpg",caption:"You too can wear this coat.

Furthermore, her blog post\nmentions that she used the instructions in a livejournal post that is no longer available.</p>\n<p>Anneke and myself did no such thing and just put the pattern together based on screengrabs from the TV show.\nWe’re hardcore like that.</p>\n<h3>About the coat</h3>\n<p>Carlton is a double-breasted long overcoat in the tradition of horseback uniform coats\nwhere the back of the coat isn’t split, but rather has wide pleats that can drape over the back of the horse.\nOr, more realistically, fan open behind you as you walk about.</p>\n<div class="row">\n<div class="col-sm-6">\n{% include figure.html url="/img/blog/announcing-carlton-and-bent/front.jpg" description="Front view of Carlton on yours truly." %}\n</div>\n<div class="col-sm-6">\n{% include figure.html url="/img/blog/announcing-carlton-and-bent/back.jpg" description="Back view of Carlton on yours truly." %}\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>It comes with two patch pockets on the front, two map pockets at the chest, and two inner pockets.\nSix pockets in total, so you’ll have plenty of room for all your belongings.</p>\n<div class="row">\n<div class="col">\n{% include blogfigure.html img="pockets.jpg" caption="Map and patch pockets on the outside." %}\n</div>\n<div class="col">\n{% include blogfigure.html img="innerpocket.jpg" caption="Inner pockets on the inside." %}\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>I finished mine just in time for a trip to Köln to visit my beloved friend and tailor\n<a href="http://sebastian-hoofs.de/massschneider/">Sebastian Hoofs</a>.\nIt was cold as eff over there, but the coat kept me nice and warm. Not surprising since it’s made in a hefty\nwool I picked up in <a href="http://www.baccitessuti.it/en/index.html">Bacci in Florence</a> over the summer, and I took\nthe extra step of interlining it with French terry (I really don’t like to be cold).</p>\n<div class="row">\n<div class="col">\n{% include blogfigure.html img="bacci.jpg" caption="I have no affiliation with Bacci, I\'m just a sucker for great fabric stores." %}\n</div>\n<div class="col">\n{% include blogfigure.html img="interlining.jpg" caption="You can see the terry interlining where I peeled back the sleeve lining." %}\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Burn the patriarchy to the ground through the power of pockets</h3>\n<p>Ladies take note: Carlita — a female version of Carlton — is currently on the drawing board.</p>\n<p>Initially, the plan was to release male and female versions side by side, but adapting the coat\nhas proven to be more involved than anticipated because, well, because boobs.</p>\n<p>I also feel like I have to\nkeep too many plates spinning right now, so I’m hopeful that getting Carlton out the door will\ncreate some time/space to make Carlita follow soon(ish). Either way, I’ve promised Anneke that we’d\ndo a female version, and <a href="/patrons">she’s a freesewing Captain now</a>, so I intend to keep that promise.</p>\n<p>Oh, and about that title: When Carlita’s ready, she will have just as many pockets as Carlton.</p>\n<h2>Also, this: Introducing the Bent Body Block</h2>\n<p>We’re actually releasing two patterns today. Apart from the Carlton Coat, there’s also\nthe <a href="/patterns/bent">Bent Body Block</a>.</p>\n<p>Bent is a two-part sleeve variation of our <a href="/patterns/bent">Brian Body Block</a>. It’s essentially a base\nfor coat and jacket patterns for menswear.</p>\n<p>I originally designed Bent as a base for my <a href="/blog/the-refashioners-2017/">refashioners 2017 zebra jacket</a>,\nso you can expect that jacket pattern to also hit the site in the coming months.</p>\n<p>Carlton is also based on Bent, so we’re giving you both today.</p>\n<p>Have wonderful and happy holidays if you’re into that kind of thing.

A book? A bird? Boobs? We may never know.”\n%}\nWe had a good run, and I feel that for any project, it’s a good way to go\nwhen you get cannibalized by something better that you inspired.</p>\n<h2>Let’s talk money</h2>\n<p>Like every year on this day, I’ve transferred all donations into the\naccount of\n<a href="http://www.msf.org/">Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders</a>.</p>\n<p>This year we came in at <strong>673.14€</strong>, so that’s what I’ve transferred.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why should we give you money in the\nfirst place if you’re just going to give it away?\n{:.quote}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I’ve also come to understand that people have a bunch of questions about this.\nLike <em>Why are you doing this?</em> and <em>Why should we give you money in the\nfirst place if you’re just going to give it away?</em></p>\n<p>These questions have led to some soul-searching recently.\nWhat I’ve learned is that it’s not easy to talk about money. Nor is it\neasy to put in words things that you know to be right, almost instinctively.</p>\n<p>But I wanted to be completely transparent about what’s going on, so I made\nthe effort to write about these things on <a href="/about/pledge">our pledge page</a>.\nAnd I’m copying them here verbatim:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h5>Noblesse oblige</h5>\n<p>You probably assume that we ask for money to keep the servers running. But that’s not exactly true.</p>\n<p>I don’t know if you’re familiar with the phrase <em>noblesse oblige</em> but it essentially means that privilege entails responsibility.</p>\n<p>I am privileged, and thus I have responsibilities. I am very fortunate to have been born in Western Europe, have a good job, and a roof over my head.</p>\n<p>Could I use the money? Yes I could.<br>\nDo I need the money? No I don’t.</p>\n<h5>The value of your support</h5>\n<p>The main risk to Freesewing is the same as any open source project out there: maintainer burnout.</p>\n<p>While I no longer carry Freesewing alone — and I can’t stress enough how much I value the work of all contributors — that doesn’t make me immune to feelings of <em>Why the fuck am I doing this?</em></p>\n<p>When people become Patrons (or donate), they give more than money. To me, the main value is the message they send to me and other people working on this. And that message is: <em>Hey, you’re doing a worthwhile thing. Keep up the good work</em>.</p>\n<h5>The value of your money</h5>\n<p>It is not just about the money. But that doesn’t mean the money is not important. Much to the contrary.</p>\n<p>Raising money by doing something I love and then passing it on to charity allows me to sleep at night.</p>\n<p>I could volunteer at a soup kitchen, or teach underprivileged children how to sew. But instead I’m working on Freesewing.</p>\n<p>Which is why all the money raised through freesewing goes to charity. It makes this project not only fun to do, but also socially responsible. And I need that to convince myself that yes, it’s OK to spend all my time doing this, because at the end of the year, I get to write a check to people who need it so much more.</p>\n<h5>Charity is not sexy</h5>\n<p>Here’s the tricky part: People donate less once they know the money goes to charity in the end. I wish it wasn’t the case, but it is.</p>\n<p>So I’m not explicitly mentioning it on our Patrons page, which is presented like you would see on a business site.</p>\n<p>Yes, everything is free, and the money doesn’t actually go to paying the server bills (because I choose to pay them out of my pocket for reasons outlined above). But that doesn’t mean that these contributions are not crucial to the well-being of the project, or at the very least its maintainer (that would be me).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Did you notice that in the text above I mentioned our Patrons page? That is because I’ve rolled out a bunch of changes today.</p>\n<p>Having taken the time to reflect on the money side of things, I’ve realized\nthat it’s an important factor in the well-being of this project.\nI also believe that donations – while motivating and appreciated – are not the best way to go about this.</p>\n<p>So, as of today, we are calling all Patrons.</p>\n<h2>Become a Patron of Freesewing</h2>\n<p>To ensure a sustainable future for <a href="http://freesewing.org">freesewing.org</a>, our code, our patterns, and our community,\nwe need to build a bedrock of loyal supporters.<br>\nPatrons who support us in our core work; Developing an open source platform for made-to-measure sewing patterns.</p>\n<p>{%\ninclude figure.html url=&quot;/img/blog/calling-all-patrons/patron-medals.jpg&quot;\ndescription=“We have three tiers of Patronage. <a href=\'/patrons/join\'>Learn more</a>”\n%}</p>\n<p>We have different tiers of Patronage, each with their own perks.

I didn’t use to, but I have\na friend Florent who inspired me to wear them (now you know where the name comes from).</p>\n<p>The first time I made a flat cap, it took me ages to scale the\npattern to an exact fit, involving a lot of messing about with tracing paper.\nThere’s a number of patterns available online for flat caps.\nBut they all come in one size only.</p>\n<p>I wanted to make this more accessible to people. And, while I was at it,\nI also drew on my experience to add some tweaks for a better fit.</p>\n<p>For example, this design extends lower at the back of the head, which\ngives it better hold.\n{:.quote.full}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This <em>why should we always have to re-invent the wheel?</em> could\npretty much be freesewing’s slogan.</p>\n<h2>It’s the season for giving</h2>\n<p>Florent requires only one measurement: the head circumference. As such,\nthis release is perfectly timed. With the holiday season coming up,\nhere’s another gift you can make yourself.</p>\n<p>Thanks Quentin!</p>\n'},{layout:"blog",title:"Monthly roundup - November 2017: Benjamin, on-boarding, showcases, and our on-demand tiler",linktitle:"Monthly roundup; November 2017 edition",img:"potw.jpg",caption:"Your new login background for the month of December",author:"Joost De Cock",category:"roundup",blurb:"A roundup of all the freesewing news of the last month",meta:{index:11,fileName:"2017-11-30-roundup-2017-11.md",section:"/blog",dirName:"/"},date:"2017-11-30",path:"/blog/blog/roundup-2017-11",permalink:"/blog/roundup-2017-11",anchors:[],body:'<p>This is your monthly roundup of the freesewing news of the last four weeks, and a look at what lies ahead in the next month.</p>\n<h2>Looking back at November</h2>\n<p>November has been busy around here. While lot of the work has been happening behind the scenes\n— more on that in December — there’s also a list of things that are already rolled out.</p>\n<p>Here’s the most important changes:</p>\n<h3>Meet Benjamin</h3>\n<p>First up: a new pattern. The Benjamin Bow tie is <a href="/patterns/benjamin">now available</a> in beta.</p>\n<div class="row">\n<div class="col">\n{% include blogfigure.html img="benjamin.jpg" caption="Wouter showing off Benjamin" %}\n</div>\n<div class="col">\n{% include blogfigure.html img="bowties.jpg" caption="More bow ties from Wouter\'s personal stash" %}\n</div>\n</div>\nBenjamin is a bow tie, and as I explained in [the announcement blog post](/blog/benjamin-bow-tie-beta/) \nthis release is kind of a big deal.\n<p>That’s because it’s the first ever pattern to have been contributed by the community.\nMore specifically, it was <a href="/users/xdpug">Wouter</a> who designed and programmed the pattern.</p>\n<p>So shout-out to him for being the first person to contribute a pattern. And if you\n<a href="https://gitter.im/freesewing/freesewing">hang around in the freesewing chat room</a>,\nyou know that he’s already started working on his next pattern.</p>\n<h3>Better user on-boarding</h3>\n<p>I’ve changed the sign-up flow a bit to help people discover all the options they can set in their account.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html url=&quot;/img/blog/roundup-2017-11/welcome.png&quot; description=“The welcome page guides you through your account setup” %}</p>\n<p>The change is two-fold. First you are now auto-magically logged in\nwhen you click the email confirmation link for your account.</p>\n<p>Second, we send you to the welcome page and guide you\nthrough a few steps to finalize your account setup. Specifically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Configure your units</li>\n<li>Configure your username</li>\n<li>Configure your profile picture</li>\n<li>Configure your social media accounts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(More on that last one later in this post)</p>\n<p>All of these settings are available in <a href="/account">your account</a>, but people\nfrequently don’t realize that.\nWith the new sign-up flow, that should no longer be the case.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h5>Hey, I never got a handy welcome page like that</h5>\n<p>At any time, you can go to <a href="/welcome">the welcome page</a>\nto check or update your account settings.\n{:.tip}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Mixed units warning</h3>\n<p>One of the issues that drove the changes to the on-boarding of new users was the\nissue of mixed units.</p>\n<p>Mixed units is when your account is configured in metric, but your model is set\nto imperial (or vice-versa).</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html\nurl=&quot;/img/blog/roundup-2017-11/units-mismatch-warning.png&quot;\ndescription=“An example warning when units are mixed between your account and your model”\n%}</p>\n<p>This is supported. If you make things for other people in other parts of the world,\nthis flexibility is handy.</p>\n<p>But it’s a rather niche scenario, and more often than not it’s due to the user not\nrealizing their units are set as they are.</p>\n<p>So now, when you draft a pattern with mixed units, we’ll show you a warning box to make\nsure that you do actually intend to use mixed units.</p>\n<h3>Per-pattern default seam allowance</h3>\n<p>The roll-out of Benjamin raised another issue: standard seam allowance.</p>\n<p>For a bow tie, the current standard seam allowance (1cm for metric, 5/8&quot; for imperial)\nis too large. So Wouter wanted some way to change the standard seam allowance.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html\nurl=&quot;/img/blog/roundup-2017-11/non-standard-sa-warning.png&quot;\ndescription=“Here too, we’ve added a little notification to make sure you are aware”\n%}\nSo, that’s what we implemented. Going forward, patterns can set the standard seam allowance\n(for both metric and imperial). If they don’t, we revert to 1cm|5/8&quot; as before.</p>\n<p>Note that this is only the default seam allowance. When you draft a pattern you can still\nset the seam allowance to whatever you like.</p>\n<h3>Social media accounts</h3>\n<p>If you clicked the link to the welcome page, or if you check out the\nsettings in <a href="/profile">your profile</a> you’ll see that you can now enter your\nusername for a few other sites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Twitter</li>\n<li>Instagram</li>\n<li>GitHub</li>\n</ul>\n<p>No need to worry, <a href="/blog/privacy-choices/">your privacy is in good hands here</a>.\nI am not interested in collecting your data, and the only reason\nthis is here is because people <a href="https://github.com/freesewing/site/issues/184">asked for it</a>.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html\nurl=&quot;/img/blog/roundup-2017-11/comments-social.png&quot;\ndescription=“After Quentin added his Instagram and GitHub accounts to his settings, his comment now have links to those accounts”\n%}\nLinks to your social media accounts will appear on your profile page and along your comments.</p>\n<h3>More showcases</h3>\n<p>We’ve added a bunch of new <a href="/showcase">showcases</a> this month.\nEvery maker that has one or more showcases here on the site has their own page\nthat lists all their showcases.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html\nurl=&quot;/img/blog/roundup-2017-11/maker-links.png&quot;\ndescription=“An example of links on a maker page. In this case, Anneke”\n%}\nThis month, we’ve updated those pages with links to the blog and/or social media\naccounts of these makers.\nThe idea is that people who feel you’ve made a cool thing can find out a bit more about you.</p>\n<h3>Referrer policy, or why you never get any visitors from <a href="http://freesewing.org">freesewing.org</a></h3>\n<p>We’ve rolled out the strictest referral policy: <code>no-referrer</code>. It blocks all referrer information.</p>\n<p>This means that if you run Google analytics – or some other website statistics tool –\non your blog or website, you won’t see traffic from <a href="http://freesewing.org">freesewing.org</a>.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html\nurl=&quot;/img/blog/roundup-2017-11/no.gif&quot;\ndescription=“Our referrer policy: No”\n%}\nThat doesn’t mean that people aren’t clicking links to your blog, but we simply\nblock the referrer header from being set, so Google has no idea where people come from.</p>\n<p>Why you ask? Because privacy.</p>\n<h3>On-demand tiler</h3>\n<p>When you draft a pattern here, you can download it in a number of formats, all neatly tiled\nso you can print them.</p>\n<p>You can also download the SVG source code to make further changes to the patterns.\nBut once you have made those changes, there’s no easy way for you to get it as a printable PDF.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html url=&quot;/img/tiler.svg&quot; description=“The on-demand tiler does what you’d expect” %}</p>\n<p>Well now there is. We’ve added <a href="/tools/tiler">an on-demand tiler</a> to the site that does just that.\nUpload your SVG, pick the format of your choice, and we’ll tile it for you.</p>\n<h2>Looking ahead to December</h2>\n<p>I had hoped to release my winter coat pattern during November, but alas that didn’t work out.\nI’m actually still making it, and when it’s ready there will be a few tweaks required to the pattern\nbefore I can release it.</p>\n<p>But that news will have to play second fiddle to our wrap up of the year\n(traditionally on December 10th here). It’s not just about what happened over the last 12 months,\nwe’ll also be rolling out some changes to safeguard the future of this project.</p>\n<p>10 more sleeps :)</p>\n'},{layout:"blog",title:"The Benjamin Bow Tie pattern is now available in beta.

The Huey Hoodie is <a href="/patterns/huey">now available</a> in beta.</p>\n<p>{% include blogfigure.html img=“huey.jpg” caption=“Hi everyone, I am Huey” %}</p>\n<p>Huey is a zip-up hoodie, have a look at <a href="/showcase/pattern/huey">the Huey showcase page</a> for examples.\n<a href="/blog/huey-hoodie-beta/">The announcement blog post</a> also explains what it means for a pattern to be in beta.</p>\n<h3>Community building</h3>\n<p>Freesewing is slowly evolving into a communal effort. The\n<a href="https://gitter.im/freesewing/freesewing">freesewing channel on Gitter</a> is turning\ninto a rather chatty place, which is really wonderful to see.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, a number of people are taking a stab at designing their own patterns with\nfreesewing. I think that’s very exciting and I’m looking forward to the day we’ll all\nbe able to enjoy the fruits of that labour.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, people are also helping out with the site, suggesting fixes and improvements\nleft and right, and <a href="/users/xdpug">Wouter</a> even added an entire page on\n<a href="/docs/git-basics">Git basics</a> which should be a great stepping stone for people who like\nhim want to get involved, but lack prior experience with Git (and GitHub).</p>\n<p>Needless to say, I am very appreciative of all contributions big and small.<br>\nIf you’d like to get involved, <a href="https://gitter.im/freesewing/freesewing">come say hi</a>.</p>\n<h3>Cover pages for patterns</h3>\n<p>This is something I’m\n<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Ba6qVTFDZv_/">kind of excited about</a>:\nbut I’ve made\n<a href="https://github.com/freesewing/tile/commit/9d2b11e7a9f0d08b890a04eced989f0b432d2c53">some changes</a>\nto <a href="https://github.com/freesewing/tile">freesewing tile</a> to add a cover page to patterns.</p>\n<p>The tile repository holds software that turns your pattern into multiple pages you can\nprint on your printer (so called tiling, hence the name).</p>\n<p>You need to sticky-tape those pages together, and even though there are markings on the pages\nto help you with that, it would be nice to have an overview page that shows the entire pattern\nand how it’s layed out over the different pages.</p>\n<p>Problem is, because freesewing patterns are drafted on the fly, based on your measurements,\nthere’s no way to know how big or small your pattern will be. In addition, you can pick a variety\nof paper sizes which will also influence how the pattern gets tiled.</p>\n<p>{% include blogfigure.html img=“tile.jpg” caption=“Turns out, you can add a coverpage is wrestle long enough with PostScript” %}</p>\n<p>So for the longest time, I felt it was simply not possible to add an coverpage with an\noverview of how everything needs to be stuck together. But everyday is a school day, and\nI’m glad to announce that starting of today, when you download a tiled PDF, it will come\nwith a cover page detailing the layout.</p>\n<p>This is obviously very new code, so if for some reason you run into trouble with the tiler,\nmake sure to <a href="https://github.com/freesewing/tile/issues/new">let me know about it</a>.</p>\n<h3>Romy will design cover images for patterns</h3>\n<p>I’ve made some changes to <a href="/patterns/">the patterns page</a> because I felt that the previous\nlayout wasn’t doing the patterns justice.</p>\n<p>While the layout is a bit better now (I think) the pictures are still a bit <em>meh</em> and they\ndon’t really say <em>freesewing</em>.</p>\n<p>So, I’ve talked to Dutch illustrator <a href="https://romyvdhel-art.deviantart.com/">Romy Van der Hel</a>\n(who also signed for our measurements illustrations)\nand I’m glad to be able to share with you that she’s agreed to do illustrations for the\ndifferent freesewing patterns.</p>\n<p>Romy will be working on these on and off, but I hope you’ll start to see more of her work\nher relatively soon.</p>\n<h2>Looking ahead to november</h2>\n<p>Last month I said I was working on 5 patterns. One of those (Huey) has been released now\nand these days I’m occupied making a test garment for another pattern on that list: a wintercoat.</p>\n<p>I don’t want to give away too much about this yet, because it’s kind of exciting, but\nI hope to be able to show more of this during the month of november. If for no other\nreason that it’s getting cold and I could really do with a warm coat.</p>\n'},{layout:"blog",title:"The Huey Hoodie is now available in beta.

No changes required.</p>\n<h2>Release early, release often</h2>\n<p>Going forward, I will release patterns as soon as I can, and work on completing the documentation while they remain in beta.</p>\n<p>I think it’s a good way to go, and adheres to the <em>release early, release often</em> mantra of open source software.</p>\n<p>If you think that’s a bad idea (or a very good idea), make sure to tell me about it in the comments below.</p>\n'},{title:"Using Firebase Auth With Nuxt.js",subtitle:"Part 1",tags:["vue","nuxt","firebase"],meta:{index:15,fileName:"2017-10-11-Nuxtjs-Firebase-Auth.md",section:"/blog",dirName:"/"},date:"2017-10-11",path:"/blog/blog/nuxtjs-firebase-auth",permalink:"/blog/nuxtjs-firebase-auth",anchors:[["#firebase-app-setup","Firebase App Setup"],["#handling-user-authentication-state","Handling User Authentication State"],["#protecting-authenticated-routes","Protecting Authenticated Routes"]],body:'<p>This article is an overview of using Nuxt.js with Firebase Authentication.

When doing so, it will <em>inherit</em> all its functions and properties, and can choose to override those with its own implementation.</p>\n<p>This scenario is common and — once you get the hang of it — rather intuitive.</p>\n<p>Patterns contain a bunch of methods, and when a method is not implemented, the method from the (grand)father class/pattern is used.</p>\n<p>{% include blogfigure.html img=“minime.jpg” caption=“Class inheritance: Think mini-me” %}</p>\n<p>But recently I bumped into a scenario where this mechanism didn’t give me the flexibility I needed.<br>\nI was dealing with a use case that is rather common in pattern design: trueing your seams.</p>\n<h2>About trueing seams</h2>\n<p>To <em>true a seam</em> is a bit of pattern design jargon. It means to match the seamlength of two seams that need to be joined together.</p>\n<p>When designing a pattern, we first come up with a shape that should work in theory. But we need to add a reality check to make sure things actually work in practice too.</p>\n<p>For example, when designing a trouser pattern, the inseam of the front leg panel and back leg panel need to be matched. But because both panels are shaped differently, there’s no guarantee they will match when the panels are drafted initially.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html url=&quot;/img/blog/where-are-we/meme.jpg&quot; description=“Actually, it’s more a matter of figuring out whether one should in the first place” %}</p>\n<p>Obviously, we can’t depend on sheer luck, so after the first basic draft of the pattern, we have to check the length of the inseam of front and back panel, and if they don’t match up, adjust them until they do.</p>\n<p>This is called <em>trueing your seams</em>. Classic pattern designers do this once when designing the pattern. But because patterns on freesewing are drafted on the fly based on your measurements, this needs to happen on the fly too.</p>\n<h2>To true or not to true? A practical example</h2>\n<p>So far so good. We need to make sure that things match up by trueing our seams. But things get more complicated when we start to extend our patterns.</p>\n<p>I recently came accross this issue while working on some new patterns, and I thought it might be a good idea to illustrate the issue based on a real-word example, and also outline my solution for it.</p>\n<p>Here’s the deal: I’m designing a new trouser block for men. It’s called <strong>Trent</strong>. I’m also, in parallel, working on a selvedge jeans block for men called <strong>Seth</strong>.</p>\n<p>The selvedge block, <strong>Seth</strong>, is based on — or extends — the regular block, <strong>Trent</strong>. Or in other words, <strong>Trent</strong> is the parent, and <strong>Seth</strong> is the child pattern.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html url=&quot;/img/blog/where-are-we/trentSeth.png&quot; description=“Seth extends Trent” %}</p>\n<p>Both of these patterns need to have their seams trued. But only if they are the last link in the chain.</p>\n<p>What I mean is, if somebody wants to use the basic Trent block, we should true its seams. Likewise, if somebody wants to use the Seth block, we should true its seams too.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You only want to true your seams at the very end of your drafting process\n{:.quote}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But here’s the catch: Seth depends on Trent, so when we draft Seth, we first draft Trent and use that as a starting point for Seth.</p>\n<p>And in this case we <strong>should not</strong>  true the seams of Trent because that is not only pointless and wasteful, it will result in a worse pattern.</p>\n<p>Think about it: We draft Trent as best as possible. Then we implement our reality-check to true the seams. In doing so, we deviate ever so slightly from the best theoretical pattern.</p>\n<p>But Seth will change the legs parts of the pattern, and so once again we will need to true these seams. So there really is no point in trueing the seems in Trent. It’s work done for nothing, and it’s better to base Seth on the optimal theoretical draft, without our reality check.</p>\n<p>It boils down to this: You only want to true your seams at the very end of your drafting process. Not somewhere at the start or in the middle.</p>\n<h2>How do you know where you are in the drafting process? Ask <code>Pattern::requested()</code></h2>\n<p>When we’re drafting our pattern, we need to know whether this is the end of the drafting process, or are we just preparing the ground work for some other pattern to extend on later.</p>\n<p>Since freesewing core v1.2.0, there’s a new method for that: <a href="/docs/core/classdocs/patterns/core/pattern#requested"><code>Pattern::requested()</code></a>.\nThis method gives you — at all times — the full class name of the pattern that was requested by the user (hence the name). In other words, the pattern at the end of our drafting process.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sometimes we want to know inside a class/pattern whether we are the actual pattern the user wants, or merely a stepping stone to get there\n{:.quote}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Knowing what pattern the user requested is one part of the equation. We also need to know where we are currently. Are we in a method implemented by the requested pattern, or in one inherited from a parent patern?</p>\n<p>Luckily, PHP has a magic variable called <code>__CLASS__</code> that always gives us the full name of the current class. In other words, the full name of the current pattern.</p>\n<p>Now we can compare <code>Pattern::requested()</code> to <code>__CLASS__</code> and if it matches, we know we should true the seams (in our example).</p>\n<p>In practice, it looks something like this:</p>\n<pre class="language-php?start_inline"><code class="language-php?start_inline">if( __CLASS__ === $this->requested() ) {\n    // True seams here\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>I hope the practical example of trueing seams was helpful. But this issue is more generic than that.</p>\n<p>It boils down to the fact that sometimes we want to know inside a class/pattern whether we are the actual pattern the user wants, or merely a stepping stone to get there.</p>\n<p>By comparing <code>$this-&gt;requested()</code> to the special <code>__CLASS__</code> variable inside a pattern, we can check at any point in any class/pattern whether this is the case or not.</p>\n'},{layout:"blog",title:"Monthly roundup - September 2017: Simon complications, email issues, and donations are up this year.",linktitle:"Monthly roundup, September 2017 edition",img:"201709.jpg",caption:"Your new login background for the month of october",author:"Joost De Cock",category:"roundup",blurb:"A roundup of all the freesewing news of the last month",meta:{index:17,fileName:"2017-09-30-roundup-2017-09.md",section:"/blog",dirName:"/"},date:"2017-09-30",path:"/blog/blog/roundup-2017-09",permalink:"/blog/roundup-2017-09",anchors:[],body:'<p>This is your monthly roundup of the freesewing news of the last four weeks, and a look at what lies ahead in the next month.</p>\n<h2>Looking back at september, and a bit of august</h2>\n<p>For this first edition, I’m looking back a bit further than one month, because <a href="/blog/open-for-business/">this site launched at the end of August</a>, so I’m including that week in this monthly roundup.</p>\n<h3>My name is Simon, and I’m complicated</h3>\n<p>Since the launch, there’s been <a href="https://github.com/freesewing/core/releases">3 new path releases of freesewing core</a> — you know, the thing that actually generates your sewing patterns — and all of them were due to issues with <a href="/patterns/simon">the Simon Shirt pattern</a>.</p>\n<p>Full details are available in <a href="https://github.com/freesewing/core/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md">the changelog</a>, but here’s the gist of it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The seam allowance at the hem was incorrect when the lenthBonus was very low.</li>\n<li>The cut in the sleeve for the placket was too short</li>\n<li>There was a problem with the seam allowance at the buttonhole placket</li>\n<li>The sleeve length bonus was counted double</li>\n<li>The hip measurements/ease was not taken into account;  The chest measurement/ease was used instead</li>\n<li>A number option defaults were tweaked</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks to <a href="/users/yrhdw">Tatyana</a> and <a href="/users/kczrw">Stefan</a> for reporting these issues.

The pattern comes with a whopping 41 options that allow you to control pretty much every aspect of your shirt.</p>\n<p>Managing all those different combinations in the code leads to a lot of complexity. And were code complexity rises, bugs appear.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html\nurl=&quot;/img/blog/roundup-2017-09/complicated.gif&quot;\ndescription=“If Simon was on facebook, its relationship status would certainly be <em>It’s complicated</em>”\n%}</p>\n<h4>Is it time for an overhaul?</h4>\n<p>Simon is a port of the Singular Shirt pattern of <a href="http://MakeMyPattern.com">MakeMyPattern.com</a>. Back there, making a differently styled shirt would have involved copying the code over, making changes, and then maintaining two slightly different variations for all eternity.</p>\n<p>Things are better here at freesewing, where inheritance is baked in the system.\nSo I could (and should perhaps) have a basic shirt pattern, and then branch that out into a bunch of differently styled shirt patterns.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>{:.folder.open} Brian Body Block\n<ul>\n<li>{:.folder.open} Basic shirt pattern\n<ul>\n<li>Casual shirt pattern</li>\n<li>Formal shirt pattern</li>\n<li>Some other shirt pattern\n{:.files}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It would not only cut down on code complexity, it would arguably also be more intuitive to see a bunch of differently styled shirt patterns, rather than have only one pattern and then have 41 options to juggle.</p>\n<p>A full Simon overhaul is going to be a bit of work, but it is possible. I’d be interested to hear your thoughts on the matter.</p>\n<h2>Dealing with email delivery issues</h2>\n<p>I added a workaround for those of you who had trouble getting the registration emails. Basically, people with an email account managed by Microsoft.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html\nurl=&quot;/img/blog/roundup-2017-09/msft.gif&quot;\ndescription=“If these guys run your inbox, then who knows what other emails you’re not getting”\n%}</p>\n<p>You can read <a href="/blog/email-spam-problems/">my blog post on the matter</a> for all the details, but basically if you have one of those addresses, you should get those emails now. The only downside is that you might get them twice.</p>\n<h2>Referrals</h2>\n<p>When people link to your site, and visitors click that link, that’s called a referral. The bloggers among you might be familiar with skimming through your Google Analytics reports to see who’s been linking to you.</p>\n<p>This site does not use Google Analytics — there’s <a href="/blog/privacy-choices/">a blog post with details on that</a> too — but still captures referrals. The overview of recent referrals is available for all to see on <a href="/status">the status page</a>.</p>\n<p>Linking to <a href="http://freesewing.org">freesewing.org</a> is obviously a nice thing to do, so I keep an eye on the referrals, and if a site shows up that belongs to a user, you get the Ambassador badge.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html\nurl=&quot;/img/badges/badge-ambassador.svg&quot;\ndescription=“Linking to <a href="http://freesewing.org">freesewing.org</a> is one way to unlock the ambassafor badge”\n%}</p>\n<p>It’s a small way to say thank you for spreading the word about freesewing.</p>\n<h2>Donations</h2>\n<p>During september, we passed last year’s donations amount, so it’s nice to see I’ll be able to <a href="/about/pledge#donations-history">send more money to MSF</a> this year than in 2016.</p>\n<p>You can always keep track of the donations on <a href="/about/pledge#donations-history">the donations pledge page</a>, but here’s the current status:</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html\nurl=&quot;/img/blog/roundup-2017-09/donations.svg&quot;\ndescription=“Yay!

You now have a choice of SVG, PDF, letter-PDF, tabloid-PDF, A4-PDF, A3-PDF, A2-PDF, A1-PDF, and A0-PDF.</p>\n<h2>The quality control badge</h2>\n<p>I’ve added the quality control badge for things like reporting (or fixing) typos, broken links, grammar, and other small improvements.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html\nurl=&quot;/img/badges/badge-quality-control.svg&quot;\ndescription=“See a typo?

And all of them are ready to the point where I need to make them to verify that they work as intended. First a muslin, and then the real thing.</p>\n<p>That’s a bit of a bottleneck for me because I have a long commute, so my sewing time is typically limited to the weekends.</p>\n<p>The only way I see to speed up the process of getting patterns released is to have people join in with the pattern testing. I don’t think it’s something I can ask people to do, because this is early stage testing. Not to mention that I have nothing to offer them to sweeten the deal. What am I going to give you, a free pattern?</p>\n<p>Still, on the off chance that some of you want to help out by making a muslin and letting me know how it went, here’s what’s currently on my drawing board:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A trouser block for men that should be better than Theo(dore)</li>\n<li>A block for selvedge jeans for men</li>\n<li>A zip-up hoodie for men</li>\n<li>A wintercoat</li>\n<li>A unisex leggins pattern</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Should any of you want to make one of these as a test, <a href="/contact">let me know</a>, it would really help me out.</p>\n'},{title:"Tips After Building a Site with Nuxt.js",tags:["vue","nuxt"],meta:{index:18,fileName:"2017-09-18-Nuxtjs-Tips.md",section:"/blog",dirName:"/"},date:"2017-09-18",path:"/blog/blog/nuxtjs-tips",permalink:"/blog/nuxtjs-tips",anchors:[["#tip-1-learn-vuex","Tip 1 - Learn Vuex"],["#tip-2-using-middleware-for-mobile-menus","Tip 2 - Using Middleware for Mobile Menus"],["#tip-3-performance","Tip 3 - Performance"]],body:'<h1 id="tip-1-learn-vuex">Tip 1 - Learn Vuex</h1>\n<p>I put off on learning Vuex for a long time, and used simpler ways of handling global state.

This will set you back $5 per month.\nIt’s basically the price of two coffees per month.</p>\n<p>With the server under my control, I’ve deployed one of Linode’s images to it.\nI went with Debian 9 because <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> is my favourite OS, and 9 is the latest\nstable release.</p>\n<p>Once it’s setup, you can boot your Linode and it’s ready to go.\nLinode will ask for a root password during the setup. Make it long and impossible to guess. And write it down for now.</p>\n<h2>Configure DNS</h2>\n<p>I’m assuming you have some sort of domain name under your control. If not, get one as\nthey are dirt cheap.</p>\n<p>I have <a href="http://decock.org">decock.org</a>, which I’ll use for the server’s primary hostname.\nAnd for the different freesewing services, I’ll use <a href="http://freesewing.org">freesewing.org</a>.</p>\n<h3>Hostname and reverse DNS</h3>\n<p>I’ve named the server <a href="http://mei.decock.org">mei.decock.org</a> (after <a href="https://overwatch.gamepedia.com/Mei">that cutie in Overwatch</a>) and so at my DNS provider\n(<a href="https://www.eurodns.com/">EuroDNS</a> should you wonder) I’ve setup and A record that points to the\nserver’s IP address: 139.162.166.219</p>\n<p>Essentially, this line in the zone file for <a href="http://decock.org">decock.org</a>:</p>\n<pre class="language-sh"><code class="language-sh">mei\t IN A  139.162.166.219\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once this is done, I configured the reverse DNS in Linode management console so that it\npoints to <a href="http://mei.decock.org">mei.decock.org</a>.</p>\n<h3>DNS for freesewing site, data, and core</h3>\n<p>Now we’re going to configure DNS for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Freesewing site: The frontend will live at <a href="http://joost.freesewing.org">joost.freesewing.org</a></li>\n<li>Freesewing data: The data backend will live at <a href="http://joost.data.freesewing.org">joost.data.freesewing.org</a></li>\n<li>Freesewing core: The core backend will live at <a href="http://joost.core.freesewing.org">joost.core.freesewing.org</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are all going to be hosted at <a href="http://mei.decock.org">mei.decock.org</a>. Technically I could make this a CNAME\nrecord for all, but I’m going to setup and A record for the site, and then point the rest\nto them with CNAME records.</p>\n<p>Like this:</p>\n<pre class="language-"><code class="language-">joost       IN A      139.162.166.219\njoost.data  IN CNAME  joost\njoost.core  IN CNAME  joost\n</code></pre>\n<p>That’s in the zone file for <a href="http://freesewing.org">freesewing.org</a>.</p>\n<h2>Initial server configuration</h2>\n<h3>Connect with SSH</h3>\n<p>There’s a few things to do on your new server. The first is to connect to it.</p>\n<p>This should do the trick:</p>\n<pre class="language-sh"><code class="language-sh">ssh joost.freesewing.org -l root\n</code></pre>\n<p>Login with your root password.</p>\n<h3>Install updates</h3>\n<p>Before we do anything else, let’s install the latest updates.</p>\n<p>First get the list of latest software:</p>\n<pre class="language-sh"><code class="language-sh">apt-get update\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then install all updates:</p>\n<pre class="language-sh"><code class="language-sh">apt-get upgrade\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Create a user for yourself</h3>\n<p>You just logged in as root. The first thing we’ll do (after installing updates)\nis create a user so you won’t ever have to log in as root again.</p>\n<p>This does the trick:</p>\n<pre class="language-sh"><code class="language-sh">adduser joost\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Obviously, the username is <em>joost</em> in this case, but you can pick whatever.\n{:.comment}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We’ve added the regular user <code>joost</code>. You will be prompted for a password, make it impossible to guess.</p>\n<p>Since we won’t be logging in as root, our privileges will be limited.</p>\n<p>That’s good, but sometimes we will need root access. So, we’ll give our user <code>sudo</code> rights.</p>\n<p>On Debian, all it takes is to add your user to the <code>sudo</code> group like this:</p>\n<pre class="language-sh"><code class="language-sh">usermod -G -a sudo joost\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Disable remote root access</h3>\n<p>Sweet, now log out of your SSH session (type <code>exit</code>) and we’ll connect again, but\nthis time as your own user. In my case, that’s <code>joost</code>.</p>\n<pre class="language-sh"><code class="language-sh">ssh joost.freesewing.org -l joost\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once you’re logged in, we’re going to prevent remote logins by root.</p>\n<p>To do so, open up the SSH server configuration file:</p>\n<pre class="language-sh"><code class="language-sh">sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n</code></pre>\n<p>Sudo will ask for your password, so enter it.</p>\n<p>Look for this line:</p>\n<pre class="language-"><code class="language-">PermitRootLogin yes\n</code></pre>\n<p>and change it to:</p>\n<pre class="language-"><code class="language-">PermitRootLogin no\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I use vi as my editor, feel free to use something else like emacs or nano\n{:.tip}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Cool. We’ve done the minimum to keep our system safe. Now let’s get freesewing up and running.</p>\n<h2>Setup git</h2>\n<p>Git is the version control system we’ll be using. It’s needed for different freesewing parts, so let’s get it\nup and running first.</p>\n<p>First install it:</p>\n<pre class="language-sh"><code class="language-sh">sudo apt-get install git\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, we’re going to create an SSH key that we can add to our GitHub account, this way\nwe can pull and push code from/to GitHub without having to worry about authentication.</p>\n<p>Create the SSH key as such:</p>\n<pre class="language-sh"><code class="language-sh">ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "joost@decock.org"\n</code></pre>\n<p>Obviously, use your own email address.</p>\n<p>You’ll be asked where to save the file. You hit Enter to accept the default location.\nYou can add a passphrase if you want to.</p>\n<p>Now, we’ll add the key to <code>ssh-agent</code>. First make sure it’s running:</p>\n<pre class="language-sh"><code class="language-sh">eval $(ssh-agent -s)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then add your key to it:</p>\n<pre class="language-sh"><code class="language-sh">ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n</code></pre>\n<p>When this is done, <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account">add your SSH key to your GitHub account</a>.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, tell git who you are:</p>\n<pre class="language-sh"><code class="language-sh">git config --global user.email "joost@decock.org"\ngit config --global user.name "Joost De Cock"\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Freesewing site</h2>\n<h3>Install software</h3>\n<p>For the website, we’re going to need the following software:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Apache</strong>, the web server</li>\n<li><strong>Bundler</strong>, the ruby package manager</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following command installs them, along with a compression library we need:</p>\n<pre class="language-sh"><code class="language-sh">sudo apt-get install apache2 bundler zlib1g-dev\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Clone the site repository</h3>\n<p>Change to your home directory, and create a subfolder called <code>git</code>, then cd into it:</p>\n<pre class="language-sh"><code class="language-sh">cd\nmkdir git\ncd git\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the <code>git</code> directory, we’ll keep all our repositories.</p>\n<p>Clone the site repo:</p>\n<pre class="language-sh"><code class="language-sh">git clone git@github.com:freesewing/site.git\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will place the <code>site</code> repository in the <code>site</code> directory.</p>\n<h3>Jekyll</h3>\n<p>cd into our new site repository, and let bundler handle the Jekyll install:</p>\n<pre class="language-sh"><code class="language-sh">cd site\nbundler install\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will install jekyll and all dependecies.</p>\n<p>Before we have Jekyll generate the site, you’ll need to update the configuration\nto reflect your own environment.</p>\n<p>The best thing to do is create your own config file in the <code>_config</code> directory.</p>\n<p>The one I use is <code>joost.yml</code>. You can copy that one, or simply make the changes in it.</p>\n<p>Only the start of the file needs to be updated. This is what it looks like:</p>\n<pre class="language-"><code class="language-">url: \'https://joost.freesewing.org/\'\ngithub: \'https://github.com/freesewing\'\ntwitter: \'freesewing_org\'\ninstagram: \'freesewing_org\'\ngitter: \'https://gitter.im/freesewing/freesewing\'\nbranch: \'develop\'\n\nfuture: true\n\napi:\n  core: \'https://joost.core.freesewing.org\'\n  data: \'https://joost.data.freesewing.org\'\n</code></pre>\n<p>These are the things to change:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>url</strong> : Set this to the url of your freesewing frontend</li>\n<li><strong>api</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>core</strong> : Set this to the url of your core backend</li>\n<li><strong>data</strong> : Set this to the url of your data backend</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once this is done, let jekyll generate the site:</p>\n<pre class="language-"><code class="language-">bundle exec jekyll build --config _config/joost.yml --incremental --watch > /dev/null 2>&amp;1 &amp;\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note that I’m pointing to my own config file here. If you used another one, update the\ncommand accordingly.\n{:.comment}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jekyll now generated our site in the <code>_site</code> directory. Now we should have apache serve up our website.</p>\n<h3>Apache</h3>\n<h4>HTTP site</h4>\n<p>Get to the apache configuration directory where site configurations are held:</p>\n<pre class="language-"><code class="language-">cd /etc/apache2/sites-available \n</code></pre>\n<p>We’re going to add a new site, so let’s create an empty file:</p>\n<pre class="language-"><code class="language-">sudo touch joost.freesewing.org.conf\n</code></pre>\n<p>To avoid having to use <code>sudo</code> everytime we want to update our site config,\nlet’s make it our file:</p>\n<pre class="language-"><code class="language-">sudo chown joost joost.freesewing.org.conf\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now open the file with your editor of choice, and add the configuration.\nHere’s mine:</p>\n<pre class="language-"><code class="language-"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>VirtualHost</span> <span class="token attr-name"><span class="token namespace">*:</span>80</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n  ServerName joost.freesewing.org\n  ServerAdmin joost@decock.org\n\n  DocumentRoot /home/joost/git/site/_site\n\n  <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>Directory</span> <span class="token punctuation">/></span></span>\n    Options FollowSymLinks\n    AllowOverride None\n  <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>Directory</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n\n  &lt;Directory /home/joost/git/site/_site>\n    Options FollowSymLinks MultiViews\n    AllowOverride None\n    Require all granted\n  <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>Directory</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n\n  LogLevel notice\n  ErrorLog /home/joost/logs/joost.site.error.log\n  CustomLog /home/joost/logs/joost.site.access.log combined\n\n  RewriteEngine on\n  RewriteCond %{SERVER_NAME} =joost.freesewing.org\n  RewriteRule ^ https://%{SERVER_NAME}%{REQUEST_URI} [END,QSA,R=permanent]\n<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>VirtualHost</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can adapt it to your own needs, most of it is self-explanatory.</p>\n<p>For now, comment out these three lines:</p>\n<pre class="language-sh"><code class="language-sh">  #RewriteEngine on\n  #RewriteCond %{SERVER_NAME} =joost.freesewing.org\n  #RewriteRule ^ https://%{SERVER_NAME}%{REQUEST_URI} [END,QSA,R=permanent]\n</code></pre>\n<p>These will force users who visit the HTTP site to the HTTPS site.\nBut since that one doesn’t work yet, we don’t need that for now.</p>\n<p>Before we tell apache about this new site, we need to create the directory where\nwe configured the log files to go:</p>\n<pre class="language-sh"><code class="language-sh">mkdir /home/joost/logs\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now tell apache about the new site, and reload the service:</p>\n<pre class="language-sh"><code class="language-sh">sudo a2ensite joost.freesewing.org.conf\nsudo service apache2 reload\n</code></pre>\n<p>If all is well, you can now point your browser to\nyour equivalent of <a href="http://joost.freesewing.org">joost.freesewing.org</a>\nand you should see the site.</p>\n<h4>HTTPS site</h4>\n<p>It’s 2017, you should encrypt your site. To do so, we’re going to install\na certificate from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a>.</p>\n<p>This is handled through certbot, so let’s install that first:</p>\n<pre class="language-sh"><code class="language-sh">sudo apt-get install certbot\n</code></pre>\n<p>When it’s done, we can get a certificate. However, this apache version on Debian 9\ncan’t be auto-configured by certbot, so we’ll do it manually.</p>\n<p>We’ll let certbot spin up a temporary webserver for this, but it can’t bind to the port\napache is already listening on. So first, we stop apache:</p>\n<pre class="language-sh"><code class="language-sh">sudo service apache stop\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, we run certbot in certificate-only mode:</p>\n<pre class="language-sh"><code class="language-sh">cerbot certonly\n</code></pre>\n<p>When prompted, pick the stand-alone server option (2) and enter your domain name.\nIn my case, it’s <code>joost.freesewing.org</code>.</p>\n<p>When you’re all done, get back to the apache site configuration directory.\nAs before, we’ll create an empty file, and change its ownership:</p>\n<pre class="language-sh"><code class="language-sh">cd /etc/apache2/sites-available \nsudo touch joost.freesewing.org-le.conf\nsudo chown joost joost.freesewing.org-le.conf\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, let’s configure.

And from the moment I shared that snippet of info\nwith a handful of friends, they’ve conspiring to get me to make a male romper.</p>\n<div class="row">\n<div class="col-sm-6">\n{% include figure.html \n    url="/img/blog/the-refashioners-2017/romper-chat.png" \n    description="<small><a href=\'https://twitter.com/scorchtorch\' target=\'_BLANK\'>Sorcha</a> trying to get me to make a romper</small>" \n%}\n</div>\n<div class="col-sm-6">\n{% include figure.html \n    url="/img/blog/the-refashioners-2017/romper-sketch.jpg" \n    description="<small><a href=\'http://www.annekecaramin.com/\' target=\'_BLANK\'>Anneke</a> trying to <em>help</em> by sketching a romper for me</small>" \n%}\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>With friends like that, who needs enemies.</p>\n<h2>How I got to zebra</h2>\n<p>The first thing I did was limit my options. Too much choice tends to paralize.</p>\n<p>I decided to not only respect the suit theme with regards to the source material, but also concerning the techniques involved.\nMaking a suit, and especially jacket construction, is a fine art and I wanted that to be part of my project.</p>\n<p>So, no messenger bags or (dare I say it) shoes out of recycled suits, I wanted to make a jacket.</p>\n<p>The problem is that suits are rather challenging to refashion. There’s just not a lot of large pieces of pristine fabric to work with.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html\nurl=&quot;/img/blog/the-refashioners-2017/front-part.jpg&quot;\ndescription=“The front part of a jacket does not leave you with a lot to work with”\n%}</p>\n<p>In addition, I’m really tall so there is simply no way I can salvage enough fabric form a suit to make a new jacket\nwithout having to sew a bunch of scraps together.</p>\n<p>I was worried that this sort of patchwork jacket was going to look super hobo.\nBut since I don’t really have any other option to make a jacket, I started thinking about what sort of patchwork would be most acceptable.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html\nurl=&quot;/img/blog/the-refashioners-2017/real-zebra.jpg&quot;\ndescription=“Eurek(zebr)a!”\n%}\nAnd then one day in the shower it hit me: zebra! If I could find a black and a white suit, I could cut them into stripes\nand join those together to form the pattern parts I needed. If it was going to be patchwork, I might as well embrace it, right?</p>\n<h2>The Blake Blazer pattern</h2>\n<p>My first idea was to make a jacket in muslin, draw zebra stripes on it, take it apart, cut out the stripes, and use that as my pattern.\nBut I was worried this process would not be precise enough.</p>\n<p>Also, what pattern would I use to make the jacket in the first place? I don’t really use patterns that I haven’t designed myself\nbecause I’m more of an uphill ice-skating kinda guy.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html\nurl=&quot;/img/blog/the-refashioners-2017/ice-skating-uphill.gif&quot;\ndescription=“Some mofos are always trying to ice-skate uphill”\n%}</p>\n<p>So, I set out to design the Blake Blazer. It’s a jacket/sportscoat pattern that I initially hoped to release with this post, but\nyou’re going to have to give me some more time for that.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html\nurl=&quot;/img/blog/the-refashioners-2017/blake.svg&quot;\ndescription=“<small>The early draft of the Blake Blazer that I used for this jacket</small>”\n%}</p>\n<p>To get those zebra stripes as precise as possible, I decided to add the stripes to the pattern.\nThis way, I could make sure they would match and whenever they don’t in the jacket, I’ve got my own shoddy workmanship to blame.</p>\n<p>Also, for this project, I decided to make it a bit of a cropped look because I was worried I wouldn’t have enough fabric to work with.</p>\n<h2>Finding suits to refashion</h2>\n<p>With my pattern sorted, I started looking into the source material for my make.\nAs it happens, I have a cardboard box full of old and unloved suits that’s still in storage since my last move.</p>\n<p>I’ve always intended to take these apart to learn from their construction so this was the perfect opportunity.</p>\n<div class="row">\n<div class="col-sm-6">\n{% include figure.html \n    url="/img/blog/the-refashioners-2017/suits-box.jpg" \n    description="<small>A box of suits to reverse engineer</small>"\n%}\n</div>\n<div class="col-sm-6">\n{% include figure.html \n    url="/img/blog/the-refashioners-2017/suits-inside.jpg" \n    description="<small>Treasure!</small>"\n%}\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>I have two black suits to choose from, but absolutely no white suits. So I hit the thriftstores only to discover that white suits are a bit of a rarity.</p>\n<p>I was unable to find any white suit even though I visited 8 different thrift stores. To make matters worse, I couldn’t even find a\nwhite suit in any of the second hand stores I visited with one exception: I found a white suit in a second hand store, but it was 200 euro.</p>\n<p>Apart from the fact that I’m not made of money, I don’t think buying a 200 euro second hand suit only to rip it apart is much in line with the spirit\nof the refashioners.</p>\n<p>I briefly contemplated a different colour combination, but nobody is waiting for a black and navy zebra.</p>\n<div class="row">\n<div class="col-sm-6">\n{% include figure.html \n    url="/img/blog/the-refashioners-2017/suits-black.jpg" \n    description="<small>I ended up using the one on the left</small>"\n%}\n</div>\n<div class="col-sm-6">\n{% include figure.html \n    url="/img/blog/the-refashioners-2017/suits-white.jpg" \n    description="<small>Never a good sign when things are secured with a steel cable</small>"\n%}\n</div>\n</div>\nFortunately, the rules of the refashioners are that at least 50% of your make should be recycled suits. Apart from that, you do what you want.\n<p>So, by making the black stripes dominant, making the entire facing out of black, and recycling the inner parts of the suit (think canvas, shouler padding, buttons and so on) I would have no problem reaching that 50% treshold.</p>\n<p>So, true to the thrifty spirit of refashioners, I picked up some white fabric in the haberdasher that was 4 euro per meter.\nSomething that I would soon regret as I tried to make this piece of glorified plastic play nice with the wool of the black suit.</p>\n<h2>Putting it all together</h2>\n<p>I wanted the zebra stripes to look like a real zebra, so no straight lines. I addition, I noticed that a zebra’s stripes don’t continue on his back and belly\nbut sort of a run before they hit the center. I wanted to replicate that look, and lived to regret it.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html\nurl=&quot;/img/blog/the-refashioners-2017/sleeve-parts.jpg&quot;\ndescription=“These scraps are waiting to become an undersleeve”\n%}\nI ended up having to hand baste all the different parts together.

I had made one muslin test garment, but now that I’ve made the real thing, I am going to go back to the pattern and make some tweaks before releasing it.</p>\n<p>In the meanwhile, enjoy some <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/__niki__/albums/72157684742893052">more pictures of the jacket in this Flickr set</a>.</p>\n<h2>Now it’s your turn</h2>\n<p>So this is it, my contribution for The Refasioners 2017.

Hopefully, that includes you.</p>\n<h3>Patterns vs drafts</h3>\n<p>I told you earlier that mmp generated over 6500 patterns.\nI can also tell you that mmp has 10 patterns available.</p>\n<p>So which one is it, 10 or 6500?\nWell, it depends on the context. Which is ambigious and confusing.</p>\n<p>Now, patterns are patterns, and drafts are drafts.<br>\nThat is, a draft is what you generate from a pattern. It’s a pattern drafted to your exact specifications.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html url=&quot;/img/blog/open-for-business/draft-sample.svg&quot; description=“An example of a draft from <a href="http://freesewing.org">freesewing.org</a>” %}</p>\n<p>I hope that in using both terms consistently, it will become self-explanatory.</p>\n<p>So, for freesewing that means there are 12 patterns available,\nfrom which a number of drafts have been generated that you can track live on\n<a href="/status">the status page</a>.</p>\n<h3>New patterns, and blocks</h3>\n<p>Currently, 12 patterns are available on <a href="http://freesewing.org">freesewing.org</a>.\nAll 10 from mmp (note: some have had their name changed)\nplus the new <a href="/patterns/sven">Sven Sweatshirt</a> and the <a href="/patterns/brian">Brian Body Block</a>.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html url=&quot;/img/showcase/sven-nr2/med_showcase.jpg&quot; description=“An example of the Sven sweatshirt” %}\nThe block also existed in the mmp backend, but it wasn’t available to you.\nSo that’s another change, I am making all my blocks (slopers) available.</p>\n<p>And more is coming, I currently have 3 patterns and 1 block that I am working on.\nThey are not ready yet, and I didn’t want to delay the release for them,\nbut I hope to have them all out before the end of the year.</p>\n<p>What I’m saying is, watch this space.\nOr better, check the links at the bottom of this page for social media accounts to follow.</p>\n<h3>Better support for <em>les autres</em></h3>\n<p>I <a href="https://makemypattern.com/blog/imperial-units-have-been-spotted-and-they-might-break-things">tried</a>\nand <a href="https://makemypattern.com/blog/imperial-units-not-worth-it">failed</a> to add support for imperial units to <a href="http://makemypattern.com">makemypattern.com</a>.</p>\n<p>This time around, both metric and imperial are fully supported. You can set your preferred units in your account settings.\nAnd in each model you can set the units seperately, just in case you happen to sew for people living in different parts of the world.</p>\n<p>Speaking of different parts of the world, freesewing core fully supports different languages.\nYou can get your pattern in a number of languages, and if yours is not listed you can help with the translation.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html url=&quot;/img/blog/open-for-business/yoke.svg&quot; description=“The yoke of Simon, in French” %}</p>\n<p>Arguably, that is a bit of a half-measure when this site is only in English, but baby steps, right?</p>\n<h3>Compare to catch issues early</h3>\n<p>One of the common pitfalls is that people take measurements the wrong way.</p>\n<p>When they generate a pattern, those incorrect measurements can sometimes really mess up the pattern\nin a way that can be hard to spot if you are not familiar with the pattern.</p>\n<p>One way to tackle that is with better measuring instructions, which I have added.\nBut what I really wanted was a way to make spot issues in an easy way.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html url=&quot;/img/blog/open-for-business/standing.jpg&quot; description=“These two are going to help you to take accurate measurements” %}</p>\n<p>Comparing yourself to others is the fastest way to be unhappy.\nBut in this case, there’s value to a comparison.</p>\n<p>Putting your pattern side by side with a pattern that is known to be correct\ncan help you spot any issues that go beyond size differences.</p>\n<p>So, comparison is built-in. Every time you generate a draft, you get two things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your drafted pattern</li>\n<li>A comparison of your draft to a range of standard sizes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>{% include figure.html url=&quot;/img/blog/open-for-business/compare-sample.svg&quot; description=“An example of a draft compared to standard sizes” %}\nIt’s a way to quickly eyeball your draft for any glaring issues before you start working with it.</p>\n<h3>Paperless because trees are precious, and printers not a given</h3>\n<p>Something that I am curious to see whether it will catch on are paperless drafts.</p>\n<p>Apart from the obvious upside of saving paper, I hope this will allow people who don’t have access to\na printer to use freesewing.</p>\n<p>The idea is that you don’t have to print your pattern.\nInstead, you can transfer it directly onto fabric or another medium.</p>\n<p>To make that possible, the pattern comes with detailed dimensions and a metric grid (or imperial grid if you’re into that)\nthat helps you transfer all the information.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html url=&quot;/img/blog/open-for-business/paperless-sample.svg&quot; description=“An example of a draft using the paperless theme” %}</p>\n<p>As I said, I’m curious to see whether this will be useful to people, but I felt it was worth a try.</p>\n<h3>I’ve got your back (up)</h3>\n<p>Also new is that when you draft a pattern, I will keep that draft for you, and it will remain available.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html url=&quot;/img/blog/open-for-business/draft-list.png&quot; description=“All your drafts are kept and available in your account” %}</p>\n<p>You can come back at any time to re-download the pattern, or tweak it, redraft it, or fork it.\nYes <a href="/docs/site/fork">fork it</a>, which is kinda cool because you can also fork patterns from other people after they’ve shared their draft.</p>\n<p>You can also add your own notes to your drafts (and to your models for that matter).</p>\n<h3>Community-driven blog and showcase</h3>\n<p>Your makes deserve better than a Flickr album somewhere, so I’ve added showcases to the site.\nThe idea is to have a grabbag of examples here on the site of things people have made.</p>\n<p>{% include figure.html url=&quot;/img/showcase/husband-hugo/med_showcase.jpg&quot;

That’s just <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">common sense</a> in 2017.</p>\n<h3>No ads</h3>\n<p>This one is another no-brainer. The number 1 tracking pest online are ad networks, and I want them nowhere near this site.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, that doesn’t pose a problem given that we don’t play by the <em>Give something for free, then sell people’s data</em> rules of the web.</p>\n<h3>No external code</h3>\n<p>This site loads no external JavaScript code. None. Which does mean I had to rethink a few things that typically require external code.</p>\n<p>There is no Facebook Like button or Twitter integration. We still have social sharing under our blog posts (hint hint) but it’s the plain vanilla HTML variety that prevents tracking.</p>\n<p>In the same category, there’s no social logins. Sure a <em>Login with Facebook</em> button is handy, but also kind of a nightmare when you consider what it does to your privacy.</p>\n<p>For a statically generated site like this (<a href="/blog/freesewing-goes-jamstack/">see this post about JAMstack for details</a>) <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> is pretty much the de facto standard for comments. But Disqus is pretty awful when it comes to tracking, so that was a big no-no to me.</p>\n<p>A similar story for authentication where I considered <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a>. There too, I was concerned about tracking, so I decided against it.</p>\n<p>I ended up just biting the bullet and implemented authentication and comments myself. Time will tell of that was a good trade-of.</p>\n<h2>No cookies</h2>\n<p>We don’t use any cookies. Obviously no third-party cookies, but not even cookies of our own.</p>\n<p>Instead, we use local storage which is better because unlike cookies, it doesn’t send your info on every request.</p>\n<h2>No analytics</h2>\n<p>I ran <a href="https://analytics.google.com/">Google Analytics</a> on <a href="https://makemypattern.com/">makemypattern</a>. It’s powerful, but obviously a tracking nightmare. So I wasn’t going to have that either.</p>\n<p>This issue is further complicated by the fact that this static site is hosted by <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. So I don’t have server logs and can’t run any analytics server-side.</p>\n<p>For the most part, I decided to just go without analytics. I don’t need to know how many people are visiting this site. I still know how many user accounts are created, and how many patterns are generated, which should be fine indicators for the site’s overall well-being.</p>\n<p>But there’s one thing that wanted to keep from analytics: the referral logs. It’s one of life’s small pleasures to go through that list and discover\n<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/freepatterns/comments/4zh5nr/is_there_software_to_generate_sewing_patterns/">somebody</a>\n<a href="http://www.makery.uk/2016/08/the-refashioners-2016-joost/">linked</a>\n<a href="https://closetcasepatterns.com/week-sewing-blogs-vol-98/">to</a>\n<a href="https://opensource.com/life/16/11/free-open-sewing-patterns">you</a>.</p>\n<p>Here too, I’ve implemented my own bare-bones solution. If you land on this site from an external link, we’ll report that referral to our own API. Which means we still get the referral info, but no tracking.</p>\n<p>Perhaps it’s just vanity, but when I’m having a bad day, those referral logs make me feel better (when it’s not just Russian referral spam). I might be wrong on this one, but I would wager that a lot of people who have their own blog can relate to that.</p>\n'},{layout:"blog",title:"We're JAMstack, we're JAMstack, we're JAMstack, we're JAMstack, we're JAMstack, we're JAMstack, we're JAMstack, and I hope you like JAMstack too",linktitle:"I hope you like JAMstack too",img:"pipes.jpg",caption:"Picture by <a href='https://stock.tookapic.com/jenniferforjoy' target='_BLANK' rel='nofollow'>Jennifer</a>",author:"Joost De Cock",category:"site",blurb:"Freesewing.org goes JAMstack, which begs the question: What does that even mean?",meta:{index:26,fileName:"2017-06-12-freesewing-goes-jamstack.md",section:"/blog",dirName:"/"},date:"2017-06-12",path:"/blog/blog/freesewing-goes-jamstack",permalink:"/blog/freesewing-goes-jamstack",anchors:[],body:'<p>When we released freesewing core at the end of March, my focus immeadiatly shifted to building our front-end so that <a href="/">freesewing.org</a> could fully replace <a href="https://makemypattern.com/">makemypattern.com</a>.</p>\n<p>I believe that the value of freesewing lies with the core platform and our patterns.\nBut without a user friendly way to expose that value, it will largely go ignored.</p>\n<p>So we needed a website that lets people generate patterns. <a href="http://Makemypattern.com">Makemypattern.com</a> — arguably the best comparison of something similar — runs on Drupal 7, and my initial idea was to run the new site on Drupal 8.\nI went down that path far enought to be confident I could get it to work, and hook it up to our backend. At which point I switched gears and turned my attention to what is now known as freesewing core.</p>\n<p>Core took about 7 months to build, and a lot has changed since then. Or perhaps I have changed, I certainly learned a lot along the way. Either way, I’ve decided to do things different.</p>\n<h2>The problem with a CMS</h2>\n<p>I have no beef with Drupal but the idea of managing the freesewing website through any Content Management System (CMS) does not appeal to me.</p>\n<p>One of the main reason is that so much information is stored under an opaque database layer which makes it difficult to manage.\nThat goes for content where posts, metadata, images, and so on is all spread across tables, locations, and folders.\nBut there’s also the theme that has a bunch of stuff in it, there’s the custom Drupal modules to connect to the backend, and so on and so forth.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I wanted that same approach in a website. Except, it can’t be static because it has to, you know, do stuff.\n{:.quote}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When we were finalizing core, I built a documentation site for it based on <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. It felt like a breath of fresh air in comparison.\nJust a bunch of markdown files, with some SASS, images, and some JavaScript thrown in the mix, and it all compiles into a neat static website.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to manage, and it integrates nicely with a GitHub-centered workflow that is going to be famliar to potential contributors.</p>\n<p>I wanted that same approach in a website. Except, it can’t be static because it has to, you know, do stuff.</p>\n<h2>An alternative approach: JAMstack</h2>\n<p>I first learned about JAMstack when I started looking into hosting for said core documentation site.\nIt was initially hosted on GitHub pages which provides free hosting.\nThey also have SSL or a custom domain name, but you can’t have both. Which was kind of a deal breaker.</p>\n<p>Looking for alternatives, I stumbled onto <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, who do both SSL and custom domains and have a free-tier for open source projects (thanks guys).\nFurthermore, <a href="https://vimeo.com/163522126">this video by Netlify CEO Mathias Biilmann</a> got me really excited about JAMstack.</p>\n<p>Unless you’re familiar with JAMstack, I suggest you check out the video, but it boils down to this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>J</strong> = JavaScript</li>\n<li><strong>A</strong> = APIs</li>\n<li><strong>M</strong> = Markup</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The idea is that you build your static site (markup) that you then make interactive with JavaScript that hooks up to one or more APIs.</p>\n<p>So in our case, rather than having a straight-forward documentation site with easy-to-edit markdown and a complex CMS to handle the dymanic stuff, let’s just build one simple site that is statically generated, yet uses JavaScript and APIs to do the smart stuff.</p>\n<h2>Running before you can walk</h2>\n<p>I must admit that in my enthousiasm to embrace this new approach I got a little ahead of myself.\nSuddenly, I was no longer building a simple site, but I was up to my eyeballs in isomorphic rendering, client-side routing, React and Redux, Node.js and ES6 transpiling.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you don’t know what any of that means, you might get a hint of the frustration I felt as I was trying to tame all these new beasts.</p>\n<p>If you do know what it all means, where were you back in April when I walked through the valley of the React of death?\n{:.comment}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Point is, I’m not a developer and I was in way over my head.\nWhile I was learning new things every day, I wasn’t making much progress on the actual task at hand, and felt frustrated with my inability to do even the most mundane things.</p>\n<p>After a month of frustration, loads of trial and seemingly even more error, I threw in the towel.\nEff this newfangled shiny JavaScript all the young kids are using, I’ll stick to what I know.</p>\n<p>Which is essentially the basics of jQuery. In other words, stuff that was pretty cool 10 years ago.</p>\n<h2>10 year old jam is still jam right?</h2>\n<p>So here we are, <a href="http://freesewing.org">freesewing.org</a> is a site powered by the JAMstack. And you know what, it seems to do what it needs to do.</p>\n<p>We have Jekyll build out static site, and when we push to our master branch, it gets autmatically deployed to Netlify.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Eff this newfangled shiny JavaScript all the young kids are using\n{:.quote}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We have <a href="https://github.com/freesewing/data">a brand new data API</a> build on <a href="https://www.slimframework.com/">the Slim framework</a>.\nIt handles all user data. Things like accounts, measurements, models, and drafts, but also comments on this website and so on.</p>\n<p>It also talks to core for us, and every time you draft a pattern, we don’t just give you the pattern, but we also run a comparison of your pattern to a range of standard sizes, which is kinda cool.</p>\n<p>And we have other cool stuff, like the ability to fork or redraft an existing draft.</p>\n<h2>This is a starting point</h2>\n<p>I hope the user experience/interface is not going to be a roadblock for people.\nI’ve made a great deal of effort to make the drafting process as intuitive as possible and I think that in comparison to our demo (or the makemypattern interface for that matter) it’s a vast improvement.</p>\n<p>Then again, I’m sure things will break left or right, or that some of you don’t like the colours or whatnot.</p>\n<p>The point is that I set out to build something that can replace <a href="http://makemypattern.com">makemypattern.com</a> so that I could tell all of you <em>Hey, come over and play with this new thing</em>.</p>\n<p>I think if nothing else, I can do that now.

Most patterns don’t.</p>\n<p>That’s because — much like clothes in the shop — patterns come in sizes.\nAnd sizes are a crude way to put people in boxes.\nThey are made for an imaginary average person, rather than for you.</p>\n<p>There’s another way, and that is to draft a pattern based on your measurements.\nThese made-to-measure patterns are vastly superior, but they require a lot of work.</p>\n<p>I wanted to change that, and that effort evolved into\n<a href="https://makemypattern.com/">MakeMyPattern.com</a>.\nI ran that site for a number of years, and it was a remarkable success.\nProbably helped by the fact that I gave away all patterns for free.</p>\n<p>In the world of home sewing, it tends to require a bit of\nexplaining why one would choose to give away their work for free.\nThings are different in the open source world where the idea of\nsharing your work with others for the benefit of all is\nthe very thread from which communities are woven.</p>\n<p>While I can’t magically bring the culture of open source\nto sewing patterns, I certainly can bring sewing patterns\ninto the open source world.</p>\n<p><a href="https://freesewing.org/">Freesewing.org</a> will continue to offer what\n<a href="https://makemypattern.com/">Makemypattern.com</a> does today:\nfree sewing patterns drafted to your measurements.\nBut additionally, it will be open to your contributions.</p>\n<p>Here’s hoping that in the Venn diagram of the somewhat geeky and sewing,\nit’s not just me in the middle.</p>\n<p>joost</p>\n<h2>Shout-outs</h2>\n<p>Freesewing is a project by <a href="https://github.com/joostdecock">Joost De Cock</a> and contributors.</p>\n<p>Hat-tip to <a href="https://github.com/jakesgordon">@jakesgordon</a> and <a href="http://www.kevlindev.com">Kevin Lindsey</a> for allowing me to port some of their code.</p>\n<p>The early-stage enthusiasm and input of\n<a href="https://github.com/diggydev">@diggydev</a>,\n<a href="https://github.com/cabi">@cabi</a>,\n<a href="https://github.com/woutervdub">@woutervdub</a>,\n<a href="https://github.com/cloutiy">@cloutiy</a>,\n<a href="https://github.com/straytaoist">@straytaoist</a>,\n<a href="https://github.com/netpraxis">@netpraxis</a>,\n<a href="https://github.com/Stefan1960">@Stefan1960</a>,\n<a href="https://github.com/brendare1">@brendare1</a>,\n<a href="https://github.com/JorisJoppe">@JorisJoppe</a>,\n<a href="https://github.com/JamJenkins">@JamJenkins</a>, and\n<a href="https://github.com/fightingrabbit">@fightingrabbit</a> has been a great boon to this project.</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/annekecaramin">@annekecaramin</a> for designing a logo cool enough to put on a Tshirt.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/scorchtorch">@scorchtorch</a> for being the best at that heart/salad/antlers thing.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, this project would not exist without the users, supporters, and donors of <a href="https://makemypattern.com/">makemypattern.com</a>.</p>\n<p>Thanks guys!</p>\n'}]}],error:null,serverRendered:!0}</script><script defer src="/_nuxt/manifest.02d96cb5c671a2d730c1.js"></script><script defer src="/_nuxt/layouts/default.6b18985b2dd8bcd3deb3.js"></script><script defer src="/_nuxt/pages/index.b8cbe10b1211b170cced.js"></script><script defer src="/_nuxt/vendor.65de81d62f64dc616a9e.js"></script><script defer src="/_nuxt/app.75b273df81eb8e65569d.js"></script>
