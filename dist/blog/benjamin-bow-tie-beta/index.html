    The Benjamin Bow Tie is now available in beta
  <h1 class="post-title">The Benjamin Bow Tie pattern is now available in beta. And I didn't even have to do anything. </h1><div><p>Our family of freesewing patterns has grown once again, and the benjamin of the family is… <a href="/patterns/benjamin">Benjamin</a>.</p>
<p>Benjamin is a bow tie that comes with a variety of options to control pretty much every aspect of your bow tie.</p>
<p>You can opt for a made-to-measure bow tie, or draft Benjamin with an adjustment ribbon to allow
some flexibility in the fit. Something that makes this a great handmade gift for the opcoming holiday season.</p>
<h2>Benjamin is more special than you realize</h2>
<p>Here’s the thing about Benjamin that I’m most excited about: I didn’t do anything.</p>
<p>{% include figure.html
url="/img/blog/benjamin-bow-tie-beta/benjamins.jpg"
description=“A collection of bow ties from Wouter, who designed and coded this pattern”
%}</p>
<p>That’s right, Benjamin was designed and coded by
<a href="/users/xdpug">Wouter Van Wageningen</a> who has over the last couple of months
been teaching himself the ins and outs of the freesewing platform:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had a blast making the Bow Tie pattern.
I basically used it to move from the BabyBib tutorial into something that was
original and not too complex (and actually useful).
I wanted to get the whole process under control before venturing out into the real stuff.</p>
<p>That I was able to pick things up so easily is due mostly to the great
<a href="/docs/designer/tutorial/part-1">BabyBib tutorial</a>
and the help you’ve provided <a href="https://gitter.im/freesewing/freesewing">here</a>.
{:.quote.full}</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Who will be next to contribute a pattern?</h2>
<p>When I released freesewing as an open source platform, I obviously hoped that others would
join the effort.</p>
<p>But I never thought that less than 3 months after the public release of freesewing,
we’d have our first pattern from the freesewing community.</p>
<p>{% include figure.html url="/img/blog/benjamin-bow-tie-beta/giphy.gif" description=“Benjamin is kind of a big deal” %}</p>
<p>So yeah, Benjamin is a BFD, Wouter is a badass, and I am hopeful that this will be the first
of many patterns that we as a community will be able to make available to all.</p>
