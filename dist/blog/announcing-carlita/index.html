    Announcing the Carlita Coat
  <h1 class="post-title">Announcing Carlita, the womenswear version of our Carlton coat. </h1><div><p>This one’s for the ladies — and I’m not (just) talking about that picture of heart-throb Benedict Cumberbatch at the top of this post.</p>
<p>Instead, I’m talking about the release of our latest pattern:
the <a href="/patterns/carlita">Carlita Coat</a> which is out in beta as of today.</p>
<p>Carlita is — you guessed it — the womenswear version of our Carlton coat, which recreates the iconic Sherlock
Holmes coat worn by BC on the BBC series.</p>
<h2>How did we do it?</h2>
<p>For details on how this project came to be,
I refer you to <a href="/blog/announcing-carlton-and-bent/">the Carlton announcement post</a>.
Here, I’d like to focus on the specifics of how we turned this menswear pattern into a coat for ladies.</p>
<p>We wanted to stay as close to the original as possible, so all we did was make changes to address
one challenge: fitting the breasts.</p>
<h3>Princess, meet your seam</h3>
<p>We drew an extra princess seam in the front panel of the coat, through which we added shaping for the bust.</p>
<p>To be able to do that accurately, Carlita requires three extra measurements in addition to the measurements required by Carlton. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="/docs/measurements/#highBust">high bust</a></li>
<li>The <a href="/docs/measurements/#bustSpan">bust span</a></li>
<li>The <a href="/docs/measurements/#highPointShoulderToBust">high point shoulder to bust</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We use your high bust measurements to draft the coat, and then do a full bust adjustment on the
princess seam based on your (full) chest circumference, bust span and HPS to bust.</p>
<h3>All of the pockets, but we had to move some of them</h3>
<p>The addition of the princess seam made the map pocket placement a bit difficult,
so we’ve slightly moved it, and aligned it vertically, rather than slightly tilted as it is in Carlton.</p>
<p>This way, the pocket can be integrated in the princess seam, somewhere in the underboob region.</p>
<h3>One extra option: The princess seam smooth factor</h3>
<p>Carlita also has one extra option that Carlton doesn’t have, the somewhat elaborately named
<a href="/docs/patterns/carlita/options#princessSeamSmoothFactor">Princess seam smooth factor</a>.</p>
<p>This controls how sharply the princess seam will revert back after having added the extra volume for your chest.</p>
<p>A picture says more than a thousand words, so here’s the option sampled on the relevant part of the pattern:</p>
<p>{% include figure.html
url="/img/blog/announcing-carlita/smooth.png"
description=“The effect of the option as shown by our sampler service”
%}</p>
<p>As you can see, the option controls the urgency with which the princess seam reverts back to your waistline
after passing the fullest point of your bust.</p>
<p>A low factor will make for a more fitted coat, but also a more curvy seam that is harder to sew.</p>
<p>A higher smooth factor will smooth this out so it’s a more sloped retreat to the downward seam.
This will make the coat less fitted under your chest, and the seam easier to sew.</p>
<h2>A reminder about made-to-measure patterns</h2>
<p>This goes without saying for regular visitors to this site, but if you’re new here, it’s worth repeating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This coat is not drafted with a certain cup size in mind. Instead, it will adapt to your chest based on your measurements.
{:.tip}</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Ladies, we need your feedback</h2>
<p>This is our first womenswear pattern with a fitted chest.
As such, we’re breaking new ground here, and I’d be interested to see how this pattern adapts to a variety of body shapes/cup sizes.</p>
<p>If you’re planning to make this coat, or a muslin of it, please share your experience, and don’t hesitate to get in
touch should you run into any issues.</p>
<p>I plan to design more womenswear patterns, so if there are any fit issues, I’d like to know about it sooner rather than later.</p>
<h2>Shout-out</h2>
<p>Last but not least, I’d like to thank <a href="http://www.annekecaramin.com/">Anneke</a> for her help throughout this project, and tolerating my countless rants about
my love/hate relationship with boobs.</p>
