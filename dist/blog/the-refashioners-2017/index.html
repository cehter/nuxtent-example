    The Refashioners 2017
  <h1 class="post-title">The Refashioners 2017 - Now with a Blake Blazer preview and 100% more zebra </h1><div><p>For the uninitiated, the refashioners is a yearly event/competition hosted by the charming (and very persuasive)
<a href="http://www.makery.uk/">Portia Lawrie</a>.</p>
<p>Its focus is on giving old, unworn, or unloved garments a new lease on life through the art of refashioning.</p>
<p>This bonanza of garment Frankensteining kicks of with a series of <em>hors-compétition</em>  makes, aimed at getting
the creative juices flowing. And <a href="http://www.makery.uk/2016/08/the-refashioners-2016-joost/">just like last year</a>,
I got asked to be one of those <em>warm-up acts</em>.</p>
<p>Before I talk a bit about how it went, here’s some pictures of what I made:</p>

<h2>The male romper lobby</h2>
<p>Last year, the theme was jeans, this year it’s suits. And from the moment I shared that snippet of info
with a handful of friends, they’ve conspiring to get me to make a male romper.</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-6">

%}
</div>
</div>
<p>With friends like that, who needs enemies.</p>
<h2>How I got to zebra</h2>
<p>The first thing I did was limit my options. Too much choice tends to paralize.</p>
<p>I decided to not only respect the suit theme with regards to the source material, but also concerning the techniques involved.
Making a suit, and especially jacket construction, is a fine art and I wanted that to be part of my project.</p>
<p>So, no messenger bags or (dare I say it) shoes out of recycled suits, I wanted to make a jacket.</p>
<p>The problem is that suits are rather challenging to refashion. There’s just not a lot of large pieces of pristine fabric to work with.</p>
<p>{% include figure.html
url="/img/blog/the-refashioners-2017/front-part.jpg"
description=“The front part of a jacket does not leave you with a lot to work with”
%}</p>
<p>In addition, I’m really tall so there is simply no way I can salvage enough fabric form a suit to make a new jacket
without having to sew a bunch of scraps together.</p>
<p>I was worried that this sort of patchwork jacket was going to look super hobo.
But since I don’t really have any other option to make a jacket, I started thinking about what sort of patchwork would be most acceptable.</p>
<p>{% include figure.html
url="/img/blog/the-refashioners-2017/real-zebra.jpg"
description=“Eurek(zebr)a!”
%}
And then one day in the shower it hit me: zebra! If I could find a black and a white suit, I could cut them into stripes
and join those together to form the pattern parts I needed. If it was going to be patchwork, I might as well embrace it, right?</p>
<h2>The Blake Blazer pattern</h2>
<p>My first idea was to make a jacket in muslin, draw zebra stripes on it, take it apart, cut out the stripes, and use that as my pattern.
But I was worried this process would not be precise enough.</p>
<p>Also, what pattern would I use to make the jacket in the first place? I don’t really use patterns that I haven’t designed myself
because I’m more of an uphill ice-skating kinda guy.</p>
<p>{% include figure.html
url="/img/blog/the-refashioners-2017/ice-skating-uphill.gif"
description=“Some mofos are always trying to ice-skate uphill”
%}</p>
<p>So, I set out to design the Blake Blazer. It’s a jacket/sportscoat pattern that I initially hoped to release with this post, but
you’re going to have to give me some more time for that.</p>
<p>{% include figure.html
url="/img/blog/the-refashioners-2017/blake.svg"
description=“<small>The early draft of the Blake Blazer that I used for this jacket</small>”
%}</p>
<p>To get those zebra stripes as precise as possible, I decided to add the stripes to the pattern.
This way, I could make sure they would match and whenever they don’t in the jacket, I’ve got my own shoddy workmanship to blame.</p>
<p>Also, for this project, I decided to make it a bit of a cropped look because I was worried I wouldn’t have enough fabric to work with.</p>
<h2>Finding suits to refashion</h2>
<p>With my pattern sorted, I started looking into the source material for my make.
As it happens, I have a cardboard box full of old and unloved suits that’s still in storage since my last move.</p>
<p>I’ve always intended to take these apart to learn from their construction so this was the perfect opportunity.</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-6">
{% include figure.html 
    url="/img/blog/the-refashioners-2017/suits-box.jpg" 
    description="<small>A box of suits to reverse engineer</small>"
%}
</div>
<div class="col-sm-6">
{% include figure.html 
    url="/img/blog/the-refashioners-2017/suits-inside.jpg" 
    description="<small>Treasure!</small>"
%}
</div>
</div>
<p>I have two black suits to choose from, but absolutely no white suits. So I hit the thriftstores only to discover that white suits are a bit of a rarity.</p>
<p>I was unable to find any white suit even though I visited 8 different thrift stores. To make matters worse, I couldn’t even find a
white suit in any of the second hand stores I visited with one exception: I found a white suit in a second hand store, but it was 200 euro.</p>
<p>Apart from the fact that I’m not made of money, I don’t think buying a 200 euro second hand suit only to rip it apart is much in line with the spirit
of the refashioners.</p>
<p>I briefly contemplated a different colour combination, but nobody is waiting for a black and navy zebra.</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-6">
{% include figure.html 
    url="/img/blog/the-refashioners-2017/suits-black.jpg" 
    description="<small>I ended up using the one on the left</small>"
%}

<div class="col-sm-6">

    url="/img/blog/the-refashioners-2017/suits-white.jpg" 
    description="<small>Never a good sign when things are secured with a steel cable</small>"
%}
</div>
</div>
Fortunately, the rules of the refashioners are that at least 50% of your make should be recycled suits. Apart from that, you do what you want.
<p>So, by making the black stripes dominant, making the entire facing out of black, and recycling the inner parts of the suit (think canvas, shouler padding, buttons and so on) I would have no problem reaching that 50% treshold.</p>
<p>So, true to the thrifty spirit of refashioners, I picked up some white fabric in the haberdasher that was 4 euro per meter.
Something that I would soon regret as I tried to make this piece of glorified plastic play nice with the wool of the black suit.</p>
<h2>Putting it all together</h2>
<p>I wanted the zebra stripes to look like a real zebra, so no straight lines. I addition, I noticed that a zebra’s stripes don’t continue on his back and belly
but sort of a run before they hit the center. I wanted to replicate that look, and lived to regret it.</p>
<p>{% include figure.html
url="/img/blog/the-refashioners-2017/sleeve-parts.jpg"
description=“These scraps are waiting to become an undersleeve”
%}
I ended up having to hand baste all the different parts together. This jacket’s outer shell is made up of 93 different scraps and pieces that are all puzzled together.</p>
<p>{% include figure.html
url="/img/blog/the-refashioners-2017/scraps.jpg"
description=“This are not scraps to be thrown out, but scraps to be made into a jacket”
%}</p>
<p>In addition, I had to squeeze all the new parts out of the old suit parts, which meant that in some cases I was left with as little as a few mm of seam allowance.
{% include figure.html

description=“Cutting new sleeve parts out of the old sleeve”
%}</p>
<p>Suffice to say, it was stressful. And after I had puzzled together the initial parts, I still had to – you know – make a jacket.
Which was kinda challenging with all that stripe matching I needed to do.</p>

<h2>Final notes</h2>
<p>I ran out of time to add the lining, but part of me feels it would be a shame to cover up the insanity that is the inside of the jacket.</p>
<p>And I’m not entirely pleased with the collar. I had made one muslin test garment, but now that I’ve made the real thing, I am going to go back to the pattern and make some tweaks before releasing it.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, enjoy some <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/__niki__/albums/72157684742893052">more pictures of the jacket in this Flickr set</a>.</p>
<h2>Now it’s your turn</h2>
<p>So this is it, my contribution for The Refasioners 2017. I hope I was able to inspire you for some refashioning of your own.
If nothing else, maybe it was a good reminder of what not to try ;)</p>
