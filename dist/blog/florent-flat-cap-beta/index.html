    The Florent Flat Cap is now available in beta
  <h1 class="post-title">The Florent Flat Cap pattern is now available in beta. That's another gift sorted. </h1><div><p>After last month’s release of <a href="/patterns/benjamin">Benjamin</a>, here’s another pattern release
to channel the dapper gentleman within: the <a href="/patterns/florent">Florent Flat Cap</a>.</p>
<p>Like Benjamin, this pattern was contributed by the freesewing community, rather than
yours truly. In this case, it was <a href="/users/ptzcb">Quentin Felix</a> who signed for the design.</p>
<p>I asked Quentin if he wanted to write this announcement blog post himself,
but he argued that it was time I did something too. He did have this to share
though, on his reasons for designing this pattern in the first place:</p>
<blockquote>
<h5>Quentin on his reasons for designing Florent</h5>
<p>I like wearing flat caps myself. I didn’t use to, but I have
a friend Florent who inspired me to wear them (now you know where the name comes from).</p>
<p>The first time I made a flat cap, it took me ages to scale the
pattern to an exact fit, involving a lot of messing about with tracing paper.
There’s a number of patterns available online for flat caps.
But they all come in one size only.</p>
<p>I wanted to make this more accessible to people. And, while I was at it,
I also drew on my experience to add some tweaks for a better fit.</p>
<p>For example, this design extends lower at the back of the head, which
gives it better hold.
{:.quote.full}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This <em>why should we always have to re-invent the wheel?</em> could
pretty much be freesewing’s slogan.</p>
<h2>It’s the season for giving</h2>
<p>Florent requires only one measurement: the head circumference. As such,
this release is perfectly timed. With the holiday season coming up,
here’s another gift you can make yourself.</p>
<p>Thanks Quentin!</p>
