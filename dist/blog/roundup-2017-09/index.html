    Monthly roundup, September 2017 edition
  <h1 class="post-title">Monthly roundup - September 2017: Simon complications, email issues, and donations are up this year. </h1><div><p>This is your monthly roundup of the freesewing news of the last four weeks, and a look at what lies ahead in the next month.</p>
<h2>Looking back at september, and a bit of august</h2>
<p>For this first edition, I’m looking back a bit further than one month, because <a href="/blog/open-for-business/">this site launched at the end of August</a>, so I’m including that week in this monthly roundup.</p>
<h3>My name is Simon, and I’m complicated</h3>
<p>Since the launch, there’s been <a href="https://github.com/freesewing/core/releases">3 new path releases of freesewing core</a> — you know, the thing that actually generates your sewing patterns — and all of them were due to issues with <a href="/patterns/simon">the Simon Shirt pattern</a>.</p>
<p>Full details are available in <a href="https://github.com/freesewing/core/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md">the changelog</a>, but here’s the gist of it:</p>
<ul>
<li>The seam allowance at the hem was incorrect when the lenthBonus was very low.</li>
<li>The cut in the sleeve for the placket was too short</li>
<li>There was a problem with the seam allowance at the buttonhole placket</li>
<li>The sleeve length bonus was counted double</li>
<li>The hip measurements/ease was not taken into account;  The chest measurement/ease was used instead</li>
<li>A number option defaults were tweaked</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to <a href="/users/yrhdw">Tatyana</a> and <a href="/users/kczrw">Stefan</a> for reporting these issues. You get that funky bug badge:</p>
<p>{% include figure.html

%}</p>
<h4>What’s your problem Simon?</h4>
<p>That these issues surface in Simon is not a coincidence. The pattern comes with a whopping 41 options that allow you to control pretty much every aspect of your shirt.</p>
<p>Managing all those different combinations in the code leads to a lot of complexity. And were code complexity rises, bugs appear.</p>
<p>{% include figure.html

description=“If Simon was on facebook, its relationship status would certainly be <em>It’s complicated</em>”
%}</p>
<h4>Is it time for an overhaul?</h4>
<p>Simon is a port of the Singular Shirt pattern of <a href="http://MakeMyPattern.com">MakeMyPattern.com</a>. Back there, making a differently styled shirt would have involved copying the code over, making changes, and then maintaining two slightly different variations for all eternity.</p>
<p>Things are better here at freesewing, where inheritance is baked in the system.
So I could (and should perhaps) have a basic shirt pattern, and then branch that out into a bunch of differently styled shirt patterns.</p>
<ul>
<li>{:.folder.open} Brian Body Block
<ul>
<li>{:.folder.open} Basic shirt pattern
<ul>
<li>Casual shirt pattern</li>
<li>Formal shirt pattern</li>
<li>Some other shirt pattern
{:.files}</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It would not only cut down on code complexity, it would arguably also be more intuitive to see a bunch of differently styled shirt patterns, rather than have only one pattern and then have 41 options to juggle.</p>
<p>A full Simon overhaul is going to be a bit of work, but it is possible. I’d be interested to hear your thoughts on the matter.</p>
<h2>Dealing with email delivery issues</h2>
<p>I added a workaround for those of you who had trouble getting the registration emails. Basically, people with an email account managed by Microsoft.</p>
<p>{% include figure.html
url="/img/blog/roundup-2017-09/msft.gif"
description=“If these guys run your inbox, then who knows what other emails you’re not getting”
%}</p>
<p>You can read <a href="/blog/email-spam-problems/">my blog post on the matter</a> for all the details, but basically if you have one of those addresses, you should get those emails now. The only downside is that you might get them twice.</p>
<h2>Referrals</h2>
<p>When people link to your site, and visitors click that link, that’s called a referral. The bloggers among you might be familiar with skimming through your Google Analytics reports to see who’s been linking to you.</p>
<p>This site does not use Google Analytics — there’s <a href="/blog/privacy-choices/">a blog post with details on that</a> too — but still captures referrals. The overview of recent referrals is available for all to see on <a href="/status">the status page</a>.</p>
<p>Linking to <a href="http://freesewing.org">freesewing.org</a> is obviously a nice thing to do, so I keep an eye on the referrals, and if a site shows up that belongs to a user, you get the Ambassador badge.</p>
<p>{% include figure.html
url="/img/badges/badge-ambassador.svg"
description=“Linking to <a href="http://freesewing.org">freesewing.org</a> is one way to unlock the ambassafor badge”
%}</p>
<p>It’s a small way to say thank you for spreading the word about freesewing.</p>
<h2>Donations</h2>
<p>During september, we passed last year’s donations amount, so it’s nice to see I’ll be able to <a href="/about/pledge#donations-history">send more money to MSF</a> this year than in 2016.</p>
<p>You can always keep track of the donations on <a href="/about/pledge#donations-history">the donations pledge page</a>, but here’s the current status:</p>
<p>{% include figure.html
url="/img/blog/roundup-2017-09/donations.svg"
description=“Yay! Better than last year”
%}</p>
<h2>More download formats</h2>
<p>I’ve also added additional formats to the draft download page. You now have a choice of SVG, PDF, letter-PDF, tabloid-PDF, A4-PDF, A3-PDF, A2-PDF, A1-PDF, and A0-PDF.</p>
<h2>The quality control badge</h2>
<p>I’ve added the quality control badge for things like reporting (or fixing) typos, broken links, grammar, and other small improvements.</p>
<p>{% include figure.html

These might not seem like an earth-shattering contribution, but they are important nevertheless.</p>
<p>On the spectrum between endlessly toiling over the perfect content before publishing it, or getting it out fast warts and all, I lean heavily towards the latter.
So I kinda count on you guys to let me know when I messed up.</p>
<h2>Looking ahead to october</h2>
<p>There are 5 patterns I am currently working on. And all of them are ready to the point where I need to make them to verify that they work as intended. First a muslin, and then the real thing.</p>
<p>That’s a bit of a bottleneck for me because I have a long commute, so my sewing time is typically limited to the weekends.</p>
<p>The only way I see to speed up the process of getting patterns released is to have people join in with the pattern testing. I don’t think it’s something I can ask people to do, because this is early stage testing. Not to mention that I have nothing to offer them to sweeten the deal. What am I going to give you, a free pattern?</p>
<p>Still, on the off chance that some of you want to help out by making a muslin and letting me know how it went, here’s what’s currently on my drawing board:</p>
<ul>
<li>A trouser block for men that should be better than Theo(dore)</li>
<li>A block for selvedge jeans for men</li>
<li>A zip-up hoodie for men</li>
<li>A wintercoat</li>
<li>A unisex leggins pattern</li>
</ul>
<p>Should any of you want to make one of these as a test, <a href="/contact">let me know</a>, it would really help me out.</p>
