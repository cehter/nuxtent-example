    The Huey Hoodie is now available in beta
  <h1 class="post-title">The Huey Hoodie is now available in beta. Which begs the question, what does it mean for a pattern to be in Beta? </h1><div><p>Welcome to <a href="/patterns/huey">Huey</a>, the youngest member in our pattern family.
Huey is a zip-up hoodie with an (optional) front pouch. I’ve made one for myself – the one in the picture above –
and I have yet to take it off since.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I’ve been wondering why the hell I didn’t design this pattern sooner.
It’s just that nice to wear.</p>
<h2>Available as of now, in beta</h2>
<p>The pattern is available <a href="/patterns/huey">right here</a>, right now, but it’s in beta.</p>
<p>To find out what that means – and why I’m doing this – just continue reading.
But if you’re itching to make this, here’s is what you need to know about beta status:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beta patterns lack documentation</li>
<li>Beta patterns are made by few people (so far)</li>
</ul>
<p>As time goes by and these issues are resolved, Huey will move from beta to core.</p>
<h2>So why this beta business</h2>
<p>As I explained in <a href="/blog/roundup-2017-09/">my round-up post of last month</a>, pattern testing is a real bottleneck for me.</p>
<p>A number of people came forward, offering to help out with testing (thank you very much for that)
which lead me to consider how this would work in practice.</p>
<p>Like, I’ve got Huey to point of <em>it works for me</em> and I am somewhat confident that it will work for others too.
Stil, nothing replaces a real-world test so it would be nice if a couple of people could make it.</p>
<p>Rather than given the opportunity to test Huey to a handful of people who came forward, I figured I might as well
open it up to everyone who feels so inclined.</p>
<p>And to indicate that this pattern isn’t as road-tested as the others, I’m keeping it in the beta namespace, where it actually is developed
and this will also show up on the pattern page. No changes required.</p>
<h2>Release early, release often</h2>
<p>Going forward, I will release patterns as soon as I can, and work on completing the documentation while they remain in beta.</p>
<p>I think it’s a good way to go, and adheres to the <em>release early, release often</em> mantra of open source software.</p>
<p>If you think that’s a bad idea (or a very good idea), make sure to tell me about it in the comments below.</p>
